        '''$kTab The idea for this notebook on observations, thoughts, and to some extent, events, going on in everyday life, has been plaguing me for sometime; now I shall begin it. The purpose will be many fold. First it will give me a chance to put down on paper many ideas and thoughts which are in a very vague state in my mind; by writing them down I will not only clarify them but will also give myself a chance to compare similar ideas at different dates and thus to note changes which are occurring within me. Possibly by noting these changes I may be able to determine the causes for them, which through it may do no one any good will at least serve to satisfy my own curiosity. $kParagraphBreak Secondly, this will serve to stimulate my intellect (I have one you know), which I fear has become very stagnant during the past year, due no doubt to laziness mainly and somewhat to the lack of stimulating surroundings. Of course in writing down odds and ends, I expect that I will no doubt aid my mode of self expression and also my writing in general. It should be excellent training for clearer and more shaped thinking, something else that I'm afraid is declining in me. From these ideas I should be able to draw more interesting material for letters and for conversation. Now that I no longer have Cousin Barbara to whom I can pour out my troubles, gripes and basic philosophy, I will put them all down in this little book; a far better idea I'm sure for I will be able to refer to them at will.  $kParagraphBreak And thirdly, I expect that I may produce some useful and helpful ideas upon which I may draw at some future date. It should even be interesting to reread after the war is over and recall the happenings which may have brought on these observations.  $kParagraphBreak And now for a word or two on procedures and subjects. I expect to continue this book faithfully, though knowing my weaknesses as I do, I should not be surprised if at sometime it died a sudden and youthful death. I must do my best to look on this as a challenge which I must meet. If it is to be worth while at all it must be kept pretty well up to date without too many long gaps. I must show myself that I can keep my enthusiasm for an idea and see it through. Now look here, you know how many times you have gotten all excited over something, only to grow tired of it and quit when the work began to grow dull. Work will always grow dull in time but you must stick to it to get any results.  $kParagraphBreak Now another point; if this is to be a true picture of yourself, you must be *frank*. No gilding the lily! Just because something didn't go quite the way you expected, don't change it. Dreaming is fine but it has its place and it is not in a report. Don't be ashamed to admit your failure. Show your weakness. If you were wrong and the fault is yours, you may as well put it down in here, because it is no worse than admitting it to yourself. It is a simpleton who tries to fool himself as well as others. And don't forget to keep your dreams and the true facts separate; imagination is fine but don't let it confuse you.  $kParagraphBreak There is to be no limit as to what goes in here, everything is acceptable from corny or amusing tales, purely imaginative dreams to the straight historic facts, but keep them separate and keep them clearly labeled. When in an idle moment you let your mind wander, why not set down some of your observations. It won't hurt you and a little writing will keep you on the touch.  $kParagraphBreak As you ream off at the mouth, so to speak, try to write it well as though it were for 'Cookie' or some other English prof. Keep an eye open for organization, grammar, and vocabulary. Who knows it may even help your spelling. Slang and colloquialisms are all right when in a conversational style but keep them out of anything which attempts to be serious unless it is for that humorous break.  $kParagraphBreak Now carry on, and don't feel that its too much work. Show me you can do it! Do a little imaginative and analytical thinking.''',

        '''$kTab On viewing my father's ship, for the first time, and noticing a few items in respect to discipline and morale I have come to the conclusion that I need to change a few of my ideas on handling men and leadership. Men will follow another man for three reasons, respect, confidence, and discipline; and it has been difficult to fit these three together.  $kParagraphBreak My policy has been to gain their friendship and thus to coax or persuade the men rather than command. This policy has its faults. Namely, men will not be led just because they think you are a pleasant chap. They will obey orders when forced by the will of the other and not when coaxed.  $kParagraphBreak Respect and confidence do hand in hand, when you have one you will gain the other. But this is difficult to do. Respect comes from your ability to do something better than another, or something the other can not do and from character and personality and friendship. Others will believe in your ability when they have it proven to them and when they come to trust your judgment.  $kParagraphBreak How can I gain these two necessary requirements? First, I should try to know as much if not more about the engineering dep't as the men under me. At least I should know enough to understand and size up all problems which may occur. It is not absolutely necessary that I know all the mechanisms of the problem but it is a great help, so long as I can come to a quick decision on what action to take. Any decision is better than none. One must gain his own confidence before he can expect to gain others. If you think you can do the job probably others will think so too. If I were to tear down a pump quicker than one of the chiefs I would probably gain some respect but not assuredly their confidence. Confidence would come from my ability to meet circumstances better than they. My knowledge of the details and intricacies of the pump would be a great help in my making a good decision as well as gaining my own confidence. My program will be to learn more details and to face the problems squarely and frequently to gain experiences and confidence.  $kParagraphBreak When these are gained, discipline can be easily maintained. But there are other parts. Friendship is a big help but should definitely not be relied on solely. The men will obey more easily and in better humor if the like you but this is not an absolute prerequisite. Too much friendship is harmful for that old saying "familiarity breeds contempt" still holds. It is better to remain somewhat aloof and reserved so that your human weaknesses will be less apparent. You should demand a certain amount of respect for your rank, at least, if not for yourself. [From now on make sure you are addressed as Mr. and sir]. Unbending and friendliness should be practiced at the proper time and place as the make the men feel that you are not stuffy or conceited, but be sure you discriminate between friendliness and weakness. That is the most difficult part and the part which can only be learned by experience. Use force as little as possible; every time you put a man on report you are admitting that you have failed; you admit to weakness. *Never use threats!* Use your will power and the force of your personality. a good "cussing out" at times does a great deal more good than harsher disciplinary action. Remember to do all you can for the crew without being soft; give them every break.  $kParagraphBreak I believe Pop to be so successful because he has a strong will and experience to know when and how much discipline to apply. He has the respect of his age and rank as well as his ability, to help him out. He enforces the policy of saluting and standing in the presence of the C.O. which is more easily done than with our skipper. A.S.B. would have a great deal of difficulty starting that aboard the Trever. If seems to be then times harder to build up discipline than to maintain it. Pop is able to maintain higher efficiency because he places faith in his officers which in turn is placed in him, and his discipline is kept uniformly. On the Trever it is unbalanced toward the smaller items. It may be relaxed somewhat on the smaller details but the important ones should be kept ridgedly. "The Beaver" is too fussy about the small items and too lax about the important ones. It is strange bu minor irritations are generally more annoying that a large inconvenience. It is the constant minor problems which make or break morale. The main reason for the Caution having better discipline, morale and upkeep is due to Pops deeper understanding of human nature. $kDoubleNewline Hints for me:$kNewlineTab Electrical Dep't - Keep better informed as to work being done and requiring work. More thorough understanding of electrical equipment and work. More knowledge of what should be done and how. Thorough inspections and insistence on cleanliness. More pressure applied to Shelly and Proza to see that work is done. $kNewlineTab Engineering Dep't - More knowledge of plant and operation. Demand more respect from men and more obedience. $kNewlineTab Aft. Compartment - More inspections, more influence for Vail. Sacks and decks and lockers neater.''',

    'entry':
        '''$kTab I have decided that one of the things I must do in my future peace-time life is to be active in politics. I believe it is every intelligent mans duty to play a part in the government of his country, and if possible an active part. There are so many people who are incompetent and stupid that the more intelligent and educated men we can have in politics the better we shall be for it. $kParagraphBreak Politics in this country for the last fifty years has been a pretty dirty job with few real compensations to the honest man and thus it has kept the well educated and ambitions soul away from it. People have left the job of running the country and making its laws to the back slapper, grafter and big machine boss. Considering what we have often had in the government, federal as well as state, we have done remarkably well but it has been far from satisfactory. We should take the cue from the British where it is the duty of every well educated man to play a part in the government in some way we must entice the educated men to enter politics as a career and certainly to get the majority to at least enter in. $kParagraphBreak At present, business men etc. refuse to have anything to do with politics other than vote, sometimes give a little money to the campaign fund of the party which will benefit them most, and mostly just grumble about the country going to the dogs. Just because one doesn't believe in some of the activities and methods used does't excuse one from remaining in one party or the other; refusing to give support and "growling" to oneself will do no good, but active disapproval or diplomatic leading may help. At least its a try. I believe my father was wrong when he drop from the American Legion because he did not believe in its policies or entering politics; too many others dropped out who might have been able to guide it along a more useful path. $kParagraphBreak One thing I believe is that after this war the veterans organizations will be potentially a great political factor. I therefore feel I should enter them wholeheartedly and try to help direct them on useful courses. I will try to gain a position of some importance in the organization. This organization can very easily be lead to do great harm to the country; it can follow the footsteps of its infamous predecessor which only agitated for veterans bonuses etc; large expenditures of money for a very small percentage of the population. It will do no good when this sort of thing occurs to get out of it and then condemn it; it won't be stopped that way. The only way I see to prevent its doing the same old barrel stuffing is to see that intelligent and sincere men gain control so that its influence can be used for the good of the country as a whole. Possibly there will be two organizations which would be an excellent thing as it would prevent one from becoming too autocratic. $kParagraphBreak As for my actual assuming a position of responsibility in such an organization; I'm not sure about how to go about it, but I expect I can see and learn the "angles" in due time. I suspect that enthusiasm, support and interest should be the beginning and that one can go on from there. Also influential friends are always a help. I have great hopes that someday some of my acquaintances will amount to some pretty important people. I shall not hesitate to use their friendships and influence to help me in any way along these lines. There are places where I draw the line but worry about them later. I do not wish to confine myself to this Veterans Organization, but I hope also to enter local and national party politic as well. I do not expect to be the actual front figure who makes speeches and holds office; I would prefer to be one of the men called in to discuss policies, or select candidates, actually an influence behind the throne. If my first plan succeeds, gaining influence in the Legion or its substitute, it should be relatively easy to have an effect on party politics. I must also gain the friendship and confidence of the local politicos and through them the more important figures. I will not forgo too many of my ideals such as hypocrisy, insincerity, "sucking around" though I expect there will be a lot of it going on around be. One cannot prevent these things by saying "I don't believe in it. I quit." one can do a great deal more good by subtly working from the inside. $kParagraphBreak Actually I don't intend to make it a career or be a small time boss, but rather a very active observer; one who is present at conventions, knows the candidate, possibly have an ear with the governor or senator. And the purpose of this? Mainly because I believe more good can be done for politics in this country and the results of politics, government and laws, by working on the inside than griping on the outside. I also hope to bring in a few others with education and background. Our country has the men but they are poorly distributed. $kParagraphBreak This idea, though stimulated by seeing the movie "Wilson", is really not new; I have had it on my mind ever since my arguments and discussions with Patterson and Furges on Tulagi last summer.''',

It seems as though it should be relatively easy to work in a reading period between 4 and chow on those days when I didn't go to the beach. Lets knock off some of this "light" or "simple" junk!''',

        '''$kTab My present existence being rather dull and the laughs and gags of the old days comming few and far between, I feel that a little light dreaming on the pleasant past is in order. I hope this will not be a bad sign that I'm showing my weakness toward being a sentimental old fart.  Let us not drift too much in the nostalgic past.$kParagraphBreak What the navy really needs is is more humor and particularly the Trever; the wit and repartee is far from snappy aboard this might vessel. Really we are all far too stuffy. My best corner in the field of humor is in anecdotes and the material I have to work with recently is very limited. The only recent experiences worthy of note: my return to the ship *rather*  inebriated with numerous possessions of one Everet Wilkinson a (jq) whom I cannot recall having ever met, and the bowing and scrapping of The Beaver when Pop came aboard; "Davis, bring the cmdr a clean plate." are far from the caliber of the tales gathered in 1301. Then there was wonderful material presented after every weekend; it never failed but that one of us would preform in some outstanding manner. The real joy, though, came in the telling and retelling, the criticisms and the few witty remarks which used to sneak into the conversations after a great deal of effort.$kParagraphBreak Honestly I must change my tack for this is getting me no place. I shall now delve into the realms of pure imagination, such as Crane the Hero, Crane Successful, Crane the Bourbon ______.$kParagraphBreak The move tonight, "National Valet" has made me decide that I really never took enough advantage from out stables, "You must have heard of the Crane stables". Though I have always enjoyed riding somehow I've done very little of it in the past eight years. To me it is a very unique sport since it must be done alone or with someone you are very close to. It frequently lacks the thrill of skiing or racing unless you are jumping. However it does give one that quiet restful enjoyment of nature which one gets craising[?].$kParagraphBreak It is a great pleasure to get away from everything and everybody, to be alone just you and your horse and the great outdoors. I can remember well the many times I've ridden up the Boulder Trail by myself and the grand feeling i've gotten just being free, alive the weather is beautiful, the scenery grand. My troubles and worries, if I have any, are completely gone; inhibitions disappear. I get the wonderful independent feeling, the horse and I are one. I talk to him and sing to myself, I'm completely happy. My imagination works overtime and I'm a complete child again dreaming great adventures and believing in them and myself implicitly. To do this with a girl you are possibly in love with is one of the pleasentest things I know. You can talk and pour out your soul or just ride and think them together. $kParagraphBreak What is there about riding that does this, is it the horse or the nature? I guess its both. Whenever I'm out in the open on a beautiful day I feel good, and that's the only way to express it, just good; happy to be alive and no other reason. But when I'm on a horse its even better, for there you have a perfect companion, one you don't have to explain to and one who feels as you do. Also when suddenly you can't contain the happiness and exuberance within you, give her her head and let her run, shout at the wind whailing by and the horse under you. Just let her go in those great open spaces its all yours, the whole world for the asking. you are tearing along with animal under you; when feeling like this you are no doubt closer to complete unity with another being than at any other time; where she goes you want to go. Then comes the thrill in making the horse obey you, of taming that powerful creature beneath you with your will. If you jump there is plenty of thrill; just like skiing a trail just in control, you can the horse are matched, neither behind the other. It's a great sport.$kParagraphBreak This is all very incongruous and disorganized but you can see how I warmed up as I got into the subject. Its been a long time since I rode like that and may it never be so long from now on.$kParagraphBreak Here's a pleasant little dream along the same subject:$kParagraphBreak I'm home and have a girl visiting me, a girl I'm in love with and who understands me well and who I understand and can really talk to. Lets call her Barbara because Coz[?] would have come pretty close to filling the picture. We start out early in a June morning while the dew is still on the trees and trot on out to the Green Gates Road. Its very cool and still as we walk along the in the hollow; the sun is just hitting the upper branches of the Hemlocks, and the dew glitters on the spider webs hanging across the trail. Underfoot the leaves are moist and the horses feeling so frisky as we jog along noiselessly. We do not speak for it seems a shame to break the stillness, which is emphasized by the warble of a bird and the crack of a twig.$kParagraphBreak I ride ahead saying nothing just feeling food because I know she is with me and thinking the same thought. I look back and smile at her and a wealth of sympathetic understanding passes between us. We pass over the bridge and the hooves on the wooden planking make a musical note as we cross over. We are early pioneers moving through the forest and this was our only mode of travel; we are explorers seeking new lands; the imaginations go on and one. The feeling of adventure is soon replaced by a feeling of reverence as we pass through the temple made by the lofty trees. The slow rhythm of the horse, the stillness and the beauty of the scene fill me with particularly religious feeling. $kParagraphBreak Soon we pass through this to the Gulf Road where the mood changes. The horses make more noise on the dirt road and the sun is brighter; we talk now of the beauty of the woods. The tempo quickens and move along at a trot. We turn off up the mountain road. The change of scenery with the hardwoods letting in more light and the frequent clearings, changes the feeling of reverence to gaiety and exuberance. As we come to the clearings we canter along, slowly at first but as the footing gets better we let the horses go. We slow after a bit with the blood pounding and a flush in our cheeks and stroll along talking now. I point out scenes along the way and tell of days in my youth. We unburden many secret thoughts and desires. I probably do too much of the talking as I show her the trees I planted; where we all used to ride. I tell of my join in just being free, in having room to move in. She tells of her early riding experiences and her trials and tribulations.$kParagraphBreak As we stop on the knoll where the trees have not yet become to high so as to cut off the sun, where the gentle breeze blowing up from the valley. There we dismount and rest, tethering the horse. We sit on a mossy rock looking down into the valley and watch the train go chugging up the grade on Day Mountain across the valley. The houses and fields are spread out before us like a painting. So fresh and clean in the early sun that they don't look real. Here the subject changes to more personal items; families, homes, futures. We try to picture what is happening in the white cottage below us.$kParagraphBreak We get back on out horses and start the return, again the moods and conversation change with the scenery and the gait. We return to the house weary, relaxed, laughing, and ready for a big lunch.$kParagraphBreak God forbid that I who love nature and the great outdoors, should ever have to live long in the city. And please God may I never be too far from the sea or the snow. If ever I have to live somewhere other than New England, let it be the Pacific Northwest.''',

        '''$kTab For the time being these arguments will only be of theoretical value as I expect the time is quite distant when I will be called upon to make a decision. Someday the time will come, i think, when I will have to decide and it may be better for me to have all my ideas, pro and con, put down so I will be able to, in the future, to see what caused my decision.$kParagraphBreak The first and main reason why I would advocate not making a career of the Navy is the difficulty it presents to a happy family life. Shipboard or shore station the same problem is present, uncertainty and constant movement. To properly raise a family the way I with to requires a permanent home in a fairly small community, a stable family life as I was accustomed. This is practically impossible when the longest time in one place is from one to three years. And the years of sea duty are also a great menace; even though much of the time may be spent ashore, there will always be considerable periods of maneuvers and cruises. These would certainly be no help to married life. It would be well nigh impossible for me to do many of the things I love so much, sailing, skiing, riding. These activities would be hard to fit in under a Navy program. I want to enjoy these sports with my whole family and when I want; I don't want my family time limited. The effect of the Navy on married life is easily seen by the large number of navy divorces.$kParagraphBreak I don't care much for the navy community or the way of promotion. The intrigue and politics of such a set up would undoubtedly throw me. Not being an Academy man would not give me much of a start and I know I'm not much suited to a life of shrewd deals and sucking around. I want to relax and be natural when I'm home. I also don't think much of the navy friendships, so many of them are forced upon you by close contact when you have no choice in who it is. I would rather be somewhere where I had a reasonable number of people to choose my friends from.$kParagraphBreak Then comes the idea of mine that I would probably be a better business man or chemist than I would a naval officer. Although that point may never be decided accurately.$kParagraphBreak Now for a few points on why there is any argument at all, why I would even consider remaining in the service. The main reason is the fact that being a goof officer still offers a challenge to me. I want to be what one would consider an excellent officer, skipper or exec; I want to be admired, looked up to, and followed. This I have not yet done. But I can imagine it would be one of the most flattering things that could happen and be one of the greatest thrills in life to have a really taut ship and have the men and officers really admire you. I can think of nothing more satisfying. That one challenge would cause me more regret than anything else about leaving the navy.$kParagraphBreak Then of course there is always the adventure and the romance attached to a roving life, new places and faces, new jobs and some exciting ones, adventure. Yes, there are plenty of possibilities for all of that in the peace-time navy. All the things that would make life hard for married men would be fairly attractive to a bachelor. There is also a certain undeniable prestige connected with a naval officer and it would certainly be something different than most of my friends.$kParagraphBreak All of these arguments could be torn apart by those that know and have done it. There must be plenty of happy and successful families in the regular navy, as well as bored and unsuccessful bachelors but their percentage would not be high. Interesting speculation but only time will tell.$kParagraphBreak A man who wishes to make the navy a career should above all things get experience in aviation. It is apparent to me that though the plane will never entirely displace the ship, it will reduce the navy's position in the next war to a relatively minor position. A ship is intrinsically a very vulnerable object because it is so concentrated. Any ship consists of a very sizable investment of time and money all placed in a very small area. Tactics such as the present suicidal dives make this a great weakness, for one plane, a sunk or extensively damaged ship, a much larger investment. In the next war with its improvements on bombs, radio control jets, etc., the problem of ship defense will certainly be very great. The advantage will continue to go to the smallest, cheapest, most destructive weapon.$kParagraphBreak The most pleasant day I've spent since seeing Pop was 20 May when I saw so many of the old Yale's; Early, Seaman, Wyer, Grobstine, and P.A. Ken Kend? and Bantar Kuskand Kevin Kenedy. With so may of us so game it was just like the old days at college. The songs, the laughter and drinks were very similar. The surrounding were different but above all there was that certain note of sadness and seriousness. There was also a feeling of desperation that we must enjoy this for we may never all be together again, certainly not for a long time. There was a distinct difference in the topics for conversation which dealt so much with the past rather than the future, as the so often used to at Yale. $kParagraphBreak It was fun and an experience of which I will always be grateful. It's too bad it can't happen more often.$kParagraphBreak I have decided definitely that I want to get of the TREVER, particularly now that we are to be converted to a target tower. Last time out there was always hope of getting in a little action and as a matter of fact we did have a few exciting times, which in a way made up for the hear, bum food, lack of mail etc.; but this time the duty is awfully dull and there is no hope of change, only the possibility of going west and its getting worse. I want to get off to see how a newer ship runs, to compare the organization, the equipment, spirit, and efficiency. I would like to see a new bunch of officers and a new skipper; I'd like to see how i fit in. I want this to be a fighting ship too so I can watch the organization in action and I want to learn. It would, I think, be much easier on a newer ship as there would be more incentive in a snappy organization. My old craving for action and my curiosity about my behavior have again taken over. I've no doubt there will be times when I will wish I was back on the easy duty aboard the AG110 but on the whole I don't think I'll regret it. ''',

        '''$kTab Having heard a rumor that Early and Seaman had been seen around town, I wended my way over to the Officers Club in the hopes that I might see them and if not I could drown my sorrows in a few rounds of drinks. upon my arrival I found those two worthies, Mr Seull[?] and Mr Bones already imbibing in a few. If this was not enough to cause a celebration in itself, and I assure you it was; I've gotten pretty drunk on worse excuses than that; four more Eli's showed up, among them that old man from Elm Street Jim Wyer. Naturally amidst this this motley crew there were bound to be a few, and it easy enough to guess, who would be game for a little strenuous drinking.$kParagraphBreak As we were unable to find suitable accommodations we were forced to remain at the club after it closed at 1800, LaGuardia[?] would crap, armed with five quarts of that celebrated scotch-type "the Wilkins Family"; for your information it used to sell on the prewar market at 65¢ a pint. Despite the discouragement of a rather second-rate whiskey and accommodations which were somewhat outside the law, a few of the gamer characters, need I say more, stayed to the bitter end, and I may add by 2300 it was pretty bitter. The party would have done justice to on of those raucous affairs given by Fat Mac Marshman himself without the women, bartenders, or Rene Meyer, overcome by sentiment sticking his sword through the ceiling as a finale to Bright College Years; we didn't have the sword. In short there was really nothing but liquor and good fellows. The singing was beautiful, Early and I still shrieking for the Whiffs, you know; and the wit most refreshing, although not as original as it once was; the party was a complete success. And to top it all off there was a snapper just in memory of that great Scotch drinker Flyer Bill Early as a climax, overcome by memories of that noble drinker, quietly snapped, and with great finesse, I might add, in a secluded corner.$kParagraphBreak The singing was exquisite though we lacked our own (George M Cohen) Marshman to pull us through a few snappy "For I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" complete with gestures. Early and I tried to make up for the lack but failed rather miserably as I stumbled over a chair. The Wiff. song rendered in six or seven part harmony was touching, bringing tears to our eyes. All in all a grand evening reminiscent of some of those spent at Zate, lacking of course the able services of Norm Higgins and of Course Molly and her girls were missed sorely.''',

        '''$kTab If I were a poet I could probably express my feelings for Jim, or if I were a writer I might be able to analyze him and our relationship, but qualifying as neither I will merely put down a few random notes on my roommate and closest friend for seven years. It is nine months since his death and over a year since I saw him last and somethings I may have forgotten, but those are the minor points, most of Jim I will never forget; I only write this so that I may refresh my memory from time to time with thoughts of that delightful character.$kParagraphBreak Jim was a funny guy, a very unique character, one that would be hard to classify. Perhaps the first thing one would notice about him was his powerful personality. He contained one of the strongest will of anyone I have ever known. He was not terribly stubborn but he had a way of getting people to do what he wanted. That was the main cause of the minor conflicts between he and I. I always hated to bow to his will and would struggle to the last but the majority of the time I would lose. Even at that time I could never say exactly how he did it but the results were there. At first he would not impress you as a very responsible man as he was usually picking holes in the existing organization, but it was always apparent that he was a leader. In his own insidious way he could command a large number of followers. When the chips were down and Jim had a position of responsibility he met it fully. I remember the first time I realized this was when he was given the job of supplying food for the party at AGC before the prom. Without too much ado he produced an excellent feed. Perhaps it was better illustrated in his handling of the Phillipian the next year, but in all respects Jim lived up to his responsibilities.$kParagraphBreak Jim had one of the most original wits of any in the class. Though it may not have been the most brilliant, I may say he was probably the most quoted man in in our circle of acquaintances. Almost all the phrases which are connected with our days of Yale have come from a Dicken remark; "Ah, my non-commissioned friend"; "You are Jewish you know". Along with his wit went his very discerning mind. Jim was a very hard man to bluff and even a harder man to fool. He was particularly sharp in picking holes in his instructors arguments to say nothing of making a fool of me almost every time a got started, a thing I might add that he loved to do. His writing was correspondingly witty and amusing; for example that theme he wrote for Cookie on the CCC and his many little poems and limericks.$kParagraphBreak Basically Jim was quite shy and would never put himself forward until he was on sure ground. In front of strangers or older people he seldom said much but usually but on his little shit, innocent act which so endeared him to our parents. Yet on ground that he was sure of he did his utmost to get all he could. Among his friends he took great pleasure in doing them[?] at every turn and pulling a slick deal. THis must not be thought of as taking advantage of friendships or using us, for with him it was merely a game; no one could be long associated with him without getting in the spirit of the thing. among the roomies it was his greatest pleasure to pull some shrewd deal whereby we suffered and he gained. However if things were too tough he was only too glad to help out; perhaps not glad but with a few chosen words on our stupidity he would rather reluctantly help out. Jim had that wonderful ability of knowing just when and where to draw the line; he never went to far.$kParagraphBreak One of his most interesting characteristics was his fear of appearing to be soft hearted. Next to being made a sucker, he hated showing any sentiment or loyalty. Yet within him was one of the warmest hearts that ever beat. Only when forced would he ever admit loyalty to anything, yet he never let anyone down. I never heard him say anything particularly nice to me except when drunk and yet I know he had great affection for me. It was a never ending source of amazement to hear from someone else the complimentary things he'd said when not ten minutes before he had been telling me in no uncertain terms what a fool I was. The other amazing part to him was his paternal car of me; he was constantly dressing me in the tone of a father, forever lecturing me on my foolish ways, many of which were identical to his. When at my home he used to have long talks with my sister on ways of properly bringing me up He was that way with all the roomies though mainly to Flyer and I, probably because we needed it more than the rest. His constant criticisms during the years I knew him probably had more to do with the formation of my character than any other influence outside my family.$kParagraphBreak His attitude toward women was another peculiarity of his. I don't believe he ever felt at east with any nice girl. Though he was well liked by them all except when drunk he still had that shy attitude of his. I think he was quite lonely for some girl that would really understand him. Probably one of the reasons he so liked Pam was due to her understanding of him. He could talk to her much better than any of the others. I wonder what would have come of that if he'd lived? With "pigs" Jim was an expert, or at least he was highly successful, due no doubt to his never say die technique and lack of taste at late hours. With them he wasted no time on talk but got down to the basic idea in mind, a very interesting performance to watch.$kParagraphBreak Jim was colorful, I believe there are more anecdotes concerning Dicken than any man in the class. He had a great facility for telling tales on himself and a great ability to laugh at himself. There were very few things that he was too embarrassed to tell about if they could furnish a good laugh. He was the most honest man with himself that I'll ever know. His same clear thinking, with which he would analyze others he used with great success on himself. I could go on at length on the tales he has told of the situations hes been in, but they are only too familiar.$kParagraphBreak My epitaph to Dicken is only this; I am honored above all by the friendship he had for me, I cannot only say he was the greatest friend I ever had.''',

        '''$kTab Honestly last weekend was as good as being back in the sates. There was as much there that was reminiscent of the old college days. First and foremost  of course there was Dody bringing back many pleasant memories and thoughts of days which seem to be centuries away. There were the old familiar cracks and wit, said in the type of company where it originated,m there was Phil Barrie and the others all of who fitted in with the type of people I used to associate so much., The conversation was so familiar, the things I said and enjoyed were appreciated and vice versa. $kParagraphBreak But this is all a side line, what I really enjoyed and would have enjoyed in any company was my non-commissioned friend, Hemmingway. She was delightful, prettier than ever, and just as charming and sincere. It's impossible to explain why she made me feel the way I did; it was no only that everything went so well, but somehow I just enjoyed being with her. It was not our talk of Yale or mutual friends that did it, nor even our talks of ourselves, but just to be talking to her. And when I kissed her that was it, or at least the best initiation I've had since Feb of 1944. What I'm getting at is that for this weekend I was in the pits [in love to you uninitiated]. I need to pause for a second and study myself in the light of this statement. I remember once before when I felt this way about Dody, though it was in a more diluted sense due to the proximity of game weekends and game gals. But then for reasons known to no one including union with some of my roommates or classmates, or something like last weekend then I know that I;m the same person after all. It's the old familiar chatter, the old trite expressions, familiar personalities and above all common interest, that make me feel as if those days were back. $kParagraphBreak I hope perhaps you got some of the same feeling, it might be helpful in solving your problem. It would be a great help to one's perspective to have many of those familiar and normal memories brought so close, while we are living in these disturbed times. [Anything brining you closer to home would help you make your decision; I hope that possibly I have been able to help you make up your mind - not by anything I said or did but just by bringing some of your memories closer to you.] $kParagraphBreak Good God I didn't mean to get so deep or sound so old and wise; you may call me Mr Anthony! As if I could ever get myself squared away! $kParagraphBreak I only with that we could get together a bit more frequently. I'm hoping I may be able to make this weekend leave somewhat more common and thus get over your way now and then. $kParagraphBreak WHen I got back to the ship I found much to my suprise that they had gotten along splendidly without me and had no mishaps. Possibly they can spare me more often, I hope. $kNewline $kTab $kTab $kTab Love etc $kDoubleNewline PS $kTab This all passed off in a few weeks. But she's still a damn nice girl.''',

        '''$kTab I am particularly pleased with my new job for a number of reasons and I hope that the future will bear me out.$kParagraphBreak For the first time since I've been aboard the Trever I feel that I have a job of some importance and a position with some responsibility attached to it. Until now, I've had the feeling that the ship would really be able to get along just as well without me  and that the work I did could be just as well preformed by a capable petty officer. As electrical officer I had full responsibility for that branch of the department but I didn't feel that there was enough there to warrant an officer for full time. Also my knowledge of electricity being what it is I did not feel qualified to be of any great assistance to my men other than in an entirely administrative capacity and there was never enough men to keep me at maximum work.$kParagraphBreak I've always been one who worked best and most efficiently when pressed to my maximum. I've always enjoyed work when I think I'm getting something done or when I can flatter my ego by thinking what I'm doing is important. I've always wanted to see how I would meet any large responsibility, and now I have the chance to see how I'll make out. I feel that handling a decision constitutes a real challenge with its discipline and numerous administrative problems, not I have a chance to see how I'll meet that challenge.$kParagraphBreak On the whole I am looking forward eagerly to the next few months to see how I'll turn out. Up till now I've been full of doubts as to whether I've been what I consider a good officer. I've been weak in maintaining discipline and respect, but now with this job I'll get some practice and experience. I'll probably be able to enforce a little more respect if I really believe I've earned it. All I need is to build up a little confidence. At last I really feel that I'm doing what an officer is supposed to do; I'll have a chance to show and develop leadership. ''',

        '''$kTab The change in the atmosphere since The Beaver left is astonishing; everyone has brightened up, smiled and thought maybe this duty isn't so bad after all. I have felt it especially. Since he has left I've felt a new rush of confidence in myself, a feeling entirely lacking before; I've looked at my fellow officers and thought they really weren't such a bad lot after all. I've looked at my new job with eagerness and anticipation; previously any added responsibility was to be feared rather than hoped for. I can talk to Phil when I have any problems and don't regret having asked advice. As a matter of fact I'm pretty well reconciled to remaining aboard for another year and it does not depress me.$kParagraphBreak The trouble with our old skipper was he had an uncanny nack of making me feel uncomfortable. I never felt free to ask him advice or offer suggestions; I never felt easy whenever he was entering in the conversation. He seemed [to] have a very a very narrow point of view. His other main trouble was his lack of apportioning responsibility among his officers and men. The officers like to feel that they are officers and that the captain has faith in their ability. In my case I did more work and felt better about each time I had an increase in responsibility; I believe that the same is true of the others.$kParagraphBreak The change is certainly noticeable in the wardroom. The dinner table it cheery jokes and corny sayings are passed around freely. Cheeriness and good-humor are much more prevalent now. In fact one might say that this is a good ship.$kParagraphBreak How much this will effect the efficiency of the ship remains to be seen; however the responsibility now lies directly on the officers. We may hope for the best.''',

        '''$kTab The peace following this war will be a far greater fight than the war itself ever was, and the chances of out winning it far slimmer. The chances of completely ending all wars is almost impossible but we may hope to prevent another one for many hears. The war in itself had already laid the seeds of future wars and it seems to me that no matter how good the peace, it cannot blight them all.$kParagraphBreak The biggest effect of this war has been the opening of the east. Future historians will no doubt say that the war with Japan was caused by the economic clash between the western power and the rising eastern power of Japan. This conflict will be anything but ended by the completion of hostilities; in fact conflict will be heightened. Peace of 1950 will see a great rise in the power and prestige of the eastern world. We have already laid the foundations for a great rise of industry in China and India. Due to our presence there and out help, a few generations will see these two nations as industrial powers. They can no longer be dismissed as as countries still in the dark ages; we are now at the beginning of their Renaissance. Of course Russia is to be considered since she is essentially an eastern power, or will be at the end of the war. Her Renaissance period is nearly complete and during the war she has risen from a second rate country to probably the most influential power of all.$kParagraphBreak Chine will be the first to follow the Russian footsteps; with her might resources and tremendous supply of man power; she, when fully developed, will become a tremendous influence in the political and economic world. This peace will see her become fully industrialized. Already we are planning to send engineers to help construct hydroelectric plants, steel mills and numerous other factories. All that is needed is the education of the Chinese and this has certainly been furthered a long ways by our presence and aid to her during this war. By the very act of winning this war are we sowing the seeds of the next.$kParagraphBreak India will follow the same track though it will probably be slower than that of the Chinese. As soon as India slips from the grasp of the British as she inevitably will, she cue[?] develop rapidly. The British have nearly completed their usefulness as colonizers and empire makers and their influence will gradually recede. With American, British, and Russian money flowing in to build and construct it will not take India long to become another great power.$kParagraphBreak We can see today at the peace table the difficulties which one eastern power is causing us; think then of the day when there are three. These powers will outnumber us in men and resources and in their growing they will throw our economic set up even more out of kilter. In their growing stage they will furnish a great market but already Russia has her finger in the pie. We will need to get up plenty early in the morning to catch the Russians asleep. The comming age will see the east growing up to the west, and I fear passing her.We will not give up without a struggle but if we fight we shall be defeated.$kParagraphBreak The world as I see it as decade offer the end of hostilities will be made up of three major influences: the Anglo-American in South America and the British, Canada and Australia; the Russians which will consist of nearly all of Europe and most of the Middle East; and the Far East rising powers China and India. The first conflicts will appear between China and Russia as the Russians try to influence the Chinese. Though China may become Communist I do not believe she will ever long be totally influenced by Russia. The trouble [with] the peace treaties is that they can never successfully control the influence of economics. ''',

        '''$kTab Among the many ways by which World War II may be known to history is the war with many ends. The victory in Europe was celebrate prematurely several times and though it is not actually over in the Orient it has be announced, celebrated and announced again. $kParagraphBreak To us here in teh Pacfic the wars end has approached gradually; we all knew for a long time that Japan was finished that it was only a matter of time until Japan admitted it to the world. At any time during July i would have said that the war would last from six month to a year longer and tha we would certainly have to invade the home islands. But when the atomic bomb was released and Russia joined the war we knew pretty well that Japan was finished. Then as the rumors of peace grew and the false reports circulated we all felt that it would be only a few days before it was official. I felt the war was officially over when Japan finally agreed to our terms and that was the day we on board the Trever celebrated; that was the day on which I could say, "Well it's over, at last." $kParagraphBreak I supose the interesting thing is how I felt, what went through my mind at the time. Actually it wasn't at all the way I had thought of victory. My reaction to one of the earlier peace rumors was rather typical in a way; I was awakened at 0400 and told the wat was over; my comment was, "What the hell" and I went back to sleep. As the rumors became more and more official I began thinking that the time wasn't too distant before I'd be out of the Navy. My whole feeling was relief that I was over. I felt as I used to when I had some rather dull tedious job to do and I finally got it finished. "Then, I thought to myself, " comes the longest part, the waiting to go home, and the waiting until your life and that of your friends becomes as it used to be. When the last actual traces of war have been washed away from me then I will feel that the war is at last really ended. $kParagraphBreak Of course I know our lived will never be the same as they were before the wat because times have changed and we have changed. Things would have happened if there had been peace but it would have been much more gradually. I have grown up and accepted responsibilities, my friends are older, college days are gone for the most of us; for even those who go back, life will be much less carefree than before. But still the day I'm waiting for is when I am home with the whole family and all the Kitts ... when we can all go skiing or sailing or picnicing or anything we want; when times are normal again and I can do the things I've missed so much with the people I've missed. Then the war will be over. $kParagraphBreak I guess the biggest problem in readjustment to civilian life will be the realization and understanding of the changes in yourself and friends. The changes for the most part are those which would have taken place anyway but they are accentuated by war and service life and by the fact that there existance is made known to you so quickly and sharply. I've noticed it somewhat in my relationship to Pop. During the last four years I've seen very little of him and I'm sure that I've been with him more in his ten days here than at any other time. Any way I've noticed that our relationship is quite different that before. I see him from a different view which I didn't before. I respect certain of his abilities now which were unimport then and I barely realized existed and some things that I admired greatly in him as a child have lost their importance to me now. This same thing will occure with all my friends and family for the simple reason that I have grown up. they would have happened anyway but the realization would not have been as sharp. $kParagraphBreak I guess the experience has been valuable and I've learned a lot, but I'm afraid that some of my most enjoyable times have never been because I and they were away at war, the time is now gone an the chance lost. So it's nice to have it over because its just that much less time I'll have lost.''',

        '''$kTab Now that atomic power is on every ones lips and so much has already been said about it, and so many who know a great deal more about it than I have written about it, I suppose I am being a little trite. But I have a few jumbled thoughts on the subject which I would like to put down. $kParagraphBreak I feel fairly certain that within the next ten years a process wil be developed whereby this energy may be used as a source of commercial power. This developement will luckily come upon us gradually. Probably the expense of the first installations will be so prohibitive that only larger companies will be able to use it as a fuel for making electricity for large plants. It should then expand rapidly into the transportation field and eventually into everyday life. $kParagraphBreak In its fullest utilization atomic power should bring about a complete social and economic revolution. Power will be the cheapest of all raw materials. Machines and small motors will be built with their fuel self-contained and abundant supply to last for the life of the machine. Your automobile will never have to be refueled, your house will have its own source of electric power from a generator that costs practically nothing to sun; factory machines will be run by units with self contained power etc. Those hardest hit will be electric companies and fuel suppliers. Society will tend to decentralize with easy cheap transportation and with an extremely cheap source of power industry will also spread out instead of remaining concentrated in a few spots. $kParagraphBreak All this will not happen in ten years because there are too many problems to be over come. As I see it from here and with what I've been able to pick up in magazines and papers, the main problem will be control. Our present engines are controled by adjusting the source of power, gasoline is regulated to slow your car or stop it; electric power is regulated to control the speed and work of motors and so on; but with atomic power this cannot be done unless one is able to deal in infinitesimal quantities. Possibly it may be able to control the speed of the reaction by the use of inhibitors, neutron absorbers, such as Cadmium, but the method for doing so is a very large problem. For certain things this control might no be too important such things as large industrial plants, power plants etc where the requirement of power are nearly constant. With this type of once the reaction is started and a constant speed obtained it can go on unmolested. But with machines which must be started and stopped frequently the problem is difficult. If there is no way to control the speed of the reaction there must be some way to absorb the energy generated during th period when there is no work being done. Excess energy is a great nuisance and a hard thing to get rid of; energy not put to usefull work quite frequently does many undesirable things. $kParagraphBreak Now another big problem is to put this energy into a common usable from, such as some sort of expansion. The crudest way would be for it to heat large volumes of water making steam and going from there. But it would seem to me that atomic energy will not be really commercialized until it can be used with jest or gas turbines. Perhaps it can be used to hear large quantities of air or some other available gas and use the expansion to do work. THis I belive would be far more efficient and should not be too difficult too work out.''',

On the whole I believe that sex should be treated naturally and in a manner similar to any desire; it should be indulged in in moderation and to such a degree that there are no harmful effects. Due to the nature of the thing intercourse can be anything from a great delight to grabby orgy, and the latter is to be avoided. Being away from the company of women is apt to heighten the importance of the act itself. It seems to me that the most important part to it is the love sympathy and the feeling of of having given great pleasure to the other, that goes with the act itself. $kParagraphBreak Therefore using the above assumption, the only way to gain any real pleasure from this is by seduction; this also elliminates whores, "victory girls" and all of the "beastly pigs" one usually picks up very late on those drunken evenings. $kParagraphBreak Naturally we must take under consideration, first the girls. For me this is an easy problem in a way, though it has led nearly constantly to my complete failure. I've got to enjoy and like the girl before I can do a thing. The rough and tough usual pick up I can't stand, so she is out. Pick a girl you would enjoy if you were just going to go dancing or take to a party. If you like her half the problem is solved. $kParagraphBreak Now the object is for her to like you. This should be done naturally as you would with anyone and no particular object in mind. You treat her politely and thoughtfully -- just relax and act natural. Either she'll like you or she won't so don't sweat over it. Then tak it easy; don't go rushing for the bunk as soon as she shows any signs of warming up. You don't have to neck her th first night. You might make a gentle pass just to prove your a man but nothing forceful. $kParagraphBreak Take her out for a while until necking becomes a mater of course. Take her to nice places and have a good clean time. By this time you ought to be pretty interested in her in a friendly and physical way, but don't weaken. Now comes the time when careful plans must be made and charmingly executed. The main point is to find a place, quiet, comfortable, and above all where you are safe from interruption; also it must not be obvious A hotel room firs the bill on certain occasions but in general it is too obvious unless you can think up a suitable excuse. An apartment is good, your own or the girls if her family are out of the way and her girl friend taken care of. If the weather is warm enough, the beach is good. But above all the strategic location is essential and take a good bit of thought. Before arriving at your "lovers lair" a decoy should be presented or a red herring led across the trail such as going to a movie or a show anything which will end early enough to give you plenty of operating time and get her in the mood for a bit of loving. $kParagraphBreak When the players are in position the first move should be toward a comfortable spot. Then proceed along the usual lines for necking. Make sure you don't rush things but above all don't weaken but keep pushing things along. In general a guy is inclined to feel pretty satisfied and just let things go but you've got to keep moving along, never retreat and don't stop. Girls are human and have very strong desires; its up to you to arouse them and then keep going. One must be persistent. She may not actually want to, but she can be persuaded. $kParagraphBreak This sounds as though I've had a lot of experience with this wort of thing. Actually I've made a number of attempts but my batting average is low. We'll see how it is after this trip to the states! $kDoubleNewline${kNewline}9 Oct 1945 $kParagraphBreak I've more or less clarified my ideas on the morals and ethics concerning sexual relations. For my particular case, I've decided that I'll take what I can get with the following exceptions, whores, prostitutes, and real pigs are out, they don't even count. Of the other girls, I will let the choice be mainly thiers, for though I'll be persistant as all Hell and do my share fully, I'll do nothing really nasty like getting her too drunk to realize it or too grabby. $kParagraphBreak My ideas on the subject for women are that it is really up to them, when they really feel it is right and something they want and when they think it will be good, why go ahead. For some girls I'm convinced they'd do much better and be better and truer wives if they had a little experience before marriage. Not that they should sleep with every man who comes along, wut when they find someone they like a lot and who likes them, then go ahead.''',

        '''$kTab Dee has the honor of being the first girl to be discussed in this log and the reason for it is that she interested me so and her problem has never really been presented to me before. It didn't take me more than a few minutes talking with her for me to decide that she was over sexed; it was very evident that she liked men very much and made no bones about it. From the discussion later with Mrs. Monroe, about her mother, I could see where it came from. $kParagraphBreak I was not much interested in her problem until I went out with her later on. We spent a lot of time discussing hers and my childhood and from this talk and her actions later I can see that she has had a difficult time. She seems to have matured quite a bit earlier than other girls and much earlier than the boys her age; consequently when everyone else was thinking about dolls, baseball and other normal activities she was feeling the stirrings of sex. She was undoubtedly pretty lonely at this time since there were few girls she could feel much in common with and few boys to which she could talk. She must have worked off a lot pof this excess energy and desire by being a very energetic tomboy. $kParagraphBreak I doubt very much if sending her to Miss Walkers was a good idea. Such a monastery as that no doubt accentuated her frustrations more than ever. It would have been better to send her to a more lenient school where she could have more normal relations with boys. $kParagraphBreak As I saw her that one evening in San Diego she was very much over sexed and also rather pathetic. You could tell by the sensual way she danced and kissed that she was very frustrated and desirous. Yet she claims to be a virgin and I have no knowledge of her being otherwise. You could see how frustrated she was or rather how much of a struggle her self-denial was, by the way she pleaded with me while necking not to get her too aroused. Her virginity was due by her own admission not so much a matter of morals but rather she feared that too much experience would ruin her married life and would probably not be able to control herself. $kParagraphBreak I think that though she does have a point in some cases, she is wrong in her case. I would adviser her to go ahead and sleep, even live with someone if she wanted because I don't believe her self-denial will never settle for one man, no matter who and this frustration may even make her worse when the time comes. She should go ahead with some one she likes and who she enjoys; live with him and get used to herself under such circumstances. She ought to stick to one man at a time to avoid being too promiscuous. It might help and I'm sure it would do any harm. Her virginity won't last long anyway because I'm convinced and would lay two to one that I could make her given the proper set up within a week. And besides the longer she waits the worse she'll be when she does start. $kParagraphBreak Of course where she is pathetic and much to be ashamed is the way she does fight her desires; you can really see her struggle. She has been brough up "right", in the tradition that intercourse before marriage is to be frowned on. She tried to live up to herself and the reputation of her brother who was killed. She knows that in many cases she is being taken advantage of and that many are around just for "what they can get"/ Also she understands herself pretty well and knows how different she is from the other girls, and tries so hard to do as they do, but it is all futile. $kParagraphBreak She was surely an interesting character and I'm sorry I wasn't around for that week for more than just one reason. $kNewline $kNewline A letter $kNewline $kNewline Dear Dee, $kNewline$kTab Just to show you that I'm a gentleman of my word, if not always one of such honorable intentions, here is the letter I promised; and prompt too. Honestly, though, I would have written you anyway, if only to thank you for the very pleasant evening. It was, and I'm not kidding, one of the best times I can remember for a long time. The whole evening was wonderful, the cocktails, dinner, the dancing [and you do dance well, in more ways than one] and afterward. Please don't get me wrong; though at times I must admit my ideas were anything but gentlemanly, it was the fact that I enjoyed your company so much that I had such a good time. $kParagraphBreak We left bright and early Saturday morning despite my pleading that we stay for a few more days at least, and we are now on our long trip to Panama and Norfolk. I am looking forward to seeing the Canal Zone of which I have heard many tales; it is reputed to be quite a game spot; though we will not be there for more than a day or two. As for what will happen when we reach Norfolk, only God and Admiral King know that and they won't tell. I expect to get home for a thirty day leave sometime to rehabilitate and get used to the shore and after that no one knows. I wish you were going to be around the east sometime. $kParagraphBreak I just want to say again what a grand time it was and how I hated to leave. I really wish we could have had a couple of more evenings, though perhaps it is better that we didn't - who knows! I know we will meet again somewhere, sometime my crystal ball tells me so and I'd even bet on it. $kParagraphBreak Anyway write me now and then and though I am a lousy correspondent I will make the supreme sacrifice and drop you a line now and then of my doings about. $kNewline Lots of love etc''',

        '''$kTab The closer I get to the date of my discharge from the US Navy, more uncertain I am about what I want to do. I have several conflicting desires which make my choice rather difficult. I still have not fulfilled my wanderlust and desire for adventure, romance and experience and I feel that now is the time to get that cleaned out of my system. On the other hand I wouldn't mind doing a little more studying at college. And thirdly I'm not sure but what I could learn more and gain more experience by getting the kind of job I want to hold now and get started toward my business career. And there is also the desire to return to my prewar life around home, the family, Model Farm, the Cape, sailing, skiing etc. $kParagraphBreak In the way of adventure I would like to travel around a bit and see a few game spots, meet strange people, know different women and do different things. Though I've always been associated with the same type of people and for a while I would like to see some of the others. I could do it, with a little luck, in the Navy. I wouldn't mind going out again if I could hit some interesting places and have enough time there to learn and know the people. The Orient and Europe would be interesting if I were able to spend enough time ashore and if I could get some close contact with the people. The only unfortunate part to the navy way would be that I probably wouldn't have enough time to make really close contact with the people and most of the places would be pretty well ruined by the war. $kParagraphBreak I would also like to  take a year and just knock around the country as a civilian, where ever I wanted to go or choice would take me. I'd like to do odd jobs in different places, in cities, small towns. Alaska, perhaps Mexico and South America. Not jobs of much importance but small manual labor or unskilled jobs to make enough to live on and so that I could meet my fellows on common ground. I could start out through the Middle West, Chicago Illinois and work westward from there or I might even start in Montreal and work down to Chicago. I could take jobs such a waiters, soda jerks, anything that might be interesting. I could be a lot of interesting characters, male and female and gain a great deal of experience in kinds of work and life in the United States and surrounding territory. It like to try a few big industries just to see how they operate. I'd like to get some guy to do it with me so that I could keep from getting too fond at times and so there would be a a fellow sympathizer to enjoy the experience with. We could start out with and old car and a old suit of clothes and a couple of hundred dollars and just room. I wonder if I could take it. $kParagraphBreak Then there is the other desire, to go back to Yale and finish some of my undone work. I'd like to go back for about a year and take a few courses I missed, thermodynamics, another course in calculus, finished advanced organic and try to get a little background in nuclear chemistry or physics and perhaps a little electrical engineering. All of that would come in very handy in any chemical work I might run into in the future and they are subjects I feel I need and now lack considerably. Along with the desire for knowledge - and for me that is the best and possible the only way I would be able to force myself to absorb it - there is thought of a real peace time college life. I could have a car and travel around to the many girls colleges, lead a gay social life, be around familiar spots with old friends; there would be Zate[?] and Elilue[?] and perhaps above all the fact that the younger lads would look up to and respect me for my broader experiences and activities during the war. Actually I think it would be mainly for the studying that I would go back, and it would be very important for the work I would like to do in the future. $kParagraphBreak Along the same lines would be taking a fairly good job as a chemist in some chemical concern such as the chemical department of the OC. I have considered this fairly seriously if I can get they type of job I want. I want a job in the production end of chemicals or chemical products, a job which will utilize my knowledge of chemistry and engineering. I want a job which keeps moving, new processes, new problems and one in which I can have confidence in myself. It may be that I would learn more by getting the job and starting out on it right away than if I went back to school for a year. Also the possibility of my getting the kind of job I want will be much greater immediately after I get out than it will a from then. The idea of may does not interest me nearly as much as the kind of work and the interest I take in it. $kParagraphBreak I also know that no matter what I do I'm going to miss Model Farm and all that goes with it. Though I do want to get out from the family wing so to speak, I'm going to miss them and our life together a great, great deal. The skiing and sailing are going to be magnets with great pulling power toward bringing me back to the fold. When I start to think about getting married and raising a family I immediately connect it with Dalton and my bringing up. I hope that when the time comes I will be able to come back there to raise a large flock of new Cranes. I do not intend to dessert the fold entirely but only for a while; only for long enough to get something out of my system and to make me a little different than the others and keep me from being too conventional. $kParagraphBreak Upon thinking over the various schemes I would sum up and analyze them as follows: The first one stems from my desire to be different and to do things I've never done before. I want to see for myself what I can do and what I can't; I want to put myself in a class with everyone else and see how well I can do. I want to know a log more about human nature, I want to live with different women, do different work and know different men. In short I want experiences that won't be able to get around home and won't get after I'm settled down; experiences that many men have had, but that I have never had. It is something I want very much an probably need to get out of my system, but it is the least problematic of them all. I think I really should do it one way or another. As for the return to college, the studying end would be an excellent idea because I can already see the need for those courses, and I know that I do not have enough will power to study that stuff on my own. The part about the old college life, however is not such a good idea. I would then be living in the past and on old friendships; my experiences would dwindle to old stuff and I'm afraid I would be begin to develop into the perpetual "rah-rah old grad". As for the third, that would be the most Babbitt conventional thing I could do. That one act would tie me up quicker and stronger than anything else. If it were a job which moved me around a lot it wouldn't be too bad, but I'm afraid I would soon become the old business man. Also if my background proved weak, I would become quite frustrated due to the desire to learn it and the natural effort needed to get me to do it by myself. The last unfortunately is probably the most likely! $kParagraphBreak Right now I begin to see the truth in the saying that life is much too short.''',

        '''$kTab I believe there should be unions and I think that is a view which has become fairly well accepted by all businessmen. The Labor class is one of the largest groups of individuals and it must be represented by some organization. However to a certain extent labor should support capital rather than fight it, since capital is its livelyhood. Unions on the whole, as they stand now are not fulfilling the job they were intended to perform, namely give a voice to the workers and give them the neccessary power with which to bargain for their rights and needs. $kParagraphBreak The scale has now swung the other way, now the unions are all powerfull and there is no way of controlling them. As things stand now management has no means with which to combat union demands, which seems to be nothing more than higher wages and less work. There is a limit to which these demands can go. So far the government has been able to do little about controlling union demands or their strikes. This is a bad situation. $kParagraphBreak Now that the unions have gained recognition by government and industry and have grown to be such powerful organizations that they can influence national as well as local elections it is time that they were watched closely. It is time that unions were put under a little government supervision similar to corporation laws. There books should be opened to the public to cut down on graft[?] and the use of funds for political activities. The election system for electing the powerful labor leaders should be overhauled and made much more democratic by bringing the elections to the public. At the present time the overage worker has little say about the policies of the union or who his leaders are. Dues and initiation fees should be kept as low as possible so that there will be no discrimination. And the unions must be able to control their members so that there will be no wildcat striking or large absenteeism. $kParagraphBreak Under proper circumstances unions could be a great help to management by largely taking over personal matters. A union representative could be present in the personnel office to help workers and also to punish those who are not up to standard. I have thought that it might be worth while to have the unions own a large share of the corporation stock and have a member on the board of directors. this man would be elected by the union an would be able to present their interests in making executive decisions; he would also be able to present managements problems to the union. Since it is to labors advantage to keep business running at a profit and to managements advantage to have a happy and efficient labor organization; the two should be able to work hand in hand. $kParagraphBreak I am very interested to see the stand Higgins has taken with his labor troubles. I have often thought that if I were running a large plant and labors demands became too excessive I would call in the union officials and tell them I was through and if they were interested they could buy me out for a reasonable price. I would then say that for a good salary I'd work for them an they could run the god-damn thing and lose all the money they wanted.''',

        '''$kTab Assuming that I have a very good chance of getting about any duty I want, I am now faced with the problem of what I want. I have cut them all down to two choices, an instructor on NROTC at Yale or sea duty around China on a cam preferably. $kParagraphBreak For soft shore duty the former would be tops. It would be almost the same as going back to college. I would get an appartment, own a car, visit Zete and Elilue[?] regularly and in most ways have the life of an undergraduate, with certain advantages of being a member of the faculty. With so many of my old friends back I would would have no trouble finding drinking companions and I would be able to attend all the gamer festivities with a certain amount of prestige pertaining to my position as an instructor. I ought to be able to audit a few courses in ,y spare time and perhaps get some of the courses that I feel I missed. I would be able to fill my students full of a lot of salty bunk about how I won the war of Formosa etc. On the whole it would be perfect duty, just the perfect combination of gamerness with the proper intellectual background, a place close to home and plenty of girls I know close at hand, and a proper spot to operate from and above all not too much work to do. $kParagraphBreak Then there is the other choice; sea duty with the Asiatic Fleet. Number one reason for that seemingly peculiar idea is my old wander-lust and insatiable curiosity. I would really like to get out to China and see what its like, how the people live and above all get in on a little adventure. I would also like very much to have a job on a newer, better organized ship, in the engineering dept and see if I could handle the job. Perhaps a little regulation peace-time navy would be a good thing for me. I still have that slightly guilty feeling about not having had it very rough during the war and I should make up for it now. I'd like to see China, Japan, and some of these other romantic spots that one used to hear so much about. $kParagraphBreak Now my biggest fear in applying for this duty is that I won't see the places I want to, or if I do, I won't get the chance to run around and see the people, etc. the way I'd like to. I really have no desire to see Alithi[?], Euewetor[?] or some of those joints ever again. I would like to see civilization and new and different civilizations at that. I want to see women; plenty of women, who are different, I want to see odd customs and places. But mainly I would like to see a little of this excitement that is going on out there and take part in some of it. I want excitement and knew experiences. I'm a little worried that if I do get out there I won't find the particular things, and I know I'll kick myself for a damn fool for requesting it as soon as I do get out. $kParagraphBreak What it really comes down to is, what do I want; a gay college life, with all its weird activities under nearly ideal conditions, a life I was never able to have while at college due to the war; or a life at sea as a man and officer with lots of excitement (I hope) and not all the gay social activities which I love so well. $kParagraphBreak I'm still undecided.''',

        '''$kTab With the advent of the atomic age as ushered in by the atomic bomb, it seems to me that it is about time that we the people of the world stop this silly fighting and spent our time on other things. The time has come when there are but two possibilities either we end ware or it will end us; that I think we can agree on. Now comes the problem of how can war be ended. $kParagraphBreak I think we should tackle this problem by looking at nations as individual humans, with personalities consisting of the overage personality of their populace and leaders. Like individuals each country is different and each has its weaknesses and desires; each has the failings of the human race in a larger or smaller degree. Whereas humans fight merely with there fists or pistols, countries use armies and navies and now atomic weapons. It is possible for people to live together in a community without constant fist fights and shootings; therefore it seems to me that it is possible for nations to live together in peace, not in constant harmony perhaps, but at least in peace. Now with people this can only be done by discipline and justice. First there must be a judge or court of some kind to make the laws and decide in some legal way the quarrels and disputes which are bound to arise; second there must be some law enforcement body set up to maintain discipline and back up the rules od the court. That is is how people are governed. This organization can be set up in two ways, either by having one man seize power and enforce his laws or it can be done by democratic methods. As it stands today we the United States are the only country equipt to seize control of the world by force. It would probably be the best thing for the world if we went to war immediately and by the use of the atomic bomb took complete control of all countries in the world. And then gradually get people into the frame of mind for a freely United World and eventually give all parts certain sovereign rights much the way the states have rights in this country. Naturally this country due to public opinion could never undertake such as task in such a bloody manner. $kParagraphBreak The only other method is be nations getting together and each one giving up some of its sovereignty to a world organization. This offers a great many practical problems since no nation likes to give up its sovereignty of its own free will. I agree with Cord Meyer that the U.N.O is not strong enough to be effective; it needs more force behind it and more trust from its members. I believe that we must use our knowledge of the atomic bomb as a diplomatic club to force the other nations into line. But first to give our share of our own national sovereignty to the U.N.O. We must lead the way. We must be the first to start forcing and urging the other countries to support a string central world government.''',

        '''$kTab The "Dirty O" as it was known, despite the connotations of the name, was a fine ship. In fact it was the finest I have ever seen. That ship could out fight, out shoot, out drink, and out love any ship in the navy; it had the spirit that couldn't loose I have always thought that it was in a way too bad that she never had a war to fight, because she would be a awfully efficient fighting machine. That ship would challenge anyone at anything and beat them and they loved a good fight; if there was no one else to fight with they would fight with themselves. The crew was the finest I have ever seen and the best I ever hope to meet. $kParagraphBreak In many, many ways I was genuinely sorry to leave the "Oz" and awfully glad I made one trip on her. For one thing it was an honor to work with a bunch of men like my crew of engineers. On the whole they came aboard ship in Boston as green as any bunch I have ever seen; most of them had never been aboard ship before and even the petty officers most had never been on cams particularly this type before. It was one of the greatest feelings in the world to watch that bunch come together and form an efficient team; slowly to be sure but in two months time they were as efficient as any group I have ever seen $kParagraphBreak By far the greatest pleasure of all was knowing within myself that I had done a good job. I took the job with considerable misgiving. I had been Chief on the Tever for seven months it is true but I never did what I wanted with that ship and I never satisfied myself that I ran the engineering department as well as it could have been run; in short I was not satisfied with the job I had done. My job on the "O" was more of a challenge than anything else. It was a new ship, a power plant I was completely unfamiliar with and a damn big job. I had to organize, train, and run a brand new group of men; teach them about a plant about which I knew absolutely nothing. I took the job to prove to myself that I could do it, knowing that any faults in the set up, organization, or training would be mine. I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. $kParagraphBreak In my estimation, and that is the one that really counts in this case, I did the job damn well. We ran the plant with very little difficulty and very few casualties and they were minor. Compared to some of the we were pretty outstanding. I will say that my lucky start was awfully good to me in many ways. First I had a darn good ship, given to me in fine shape. I wouldn't trade a Bath build ship for any ship in the Navy. The ship was clean, designed well and above all the machinery was in top operating condition when I took her. I was given the grace of God and BuPers and a darn fine crew. The experienced men aI had were excellent; they learned fast and were able to pass their knowledge along to the green hands, I was also blessed with two fine assistants; Sullivan with experience as Chief Engineer on two ships was indispensable. He was hard working, likable, easy to get along with and above all a darn fine engineer. Gus was also a good engineer and industrious and easy to work with. Among the chiefs Mess was by far outstanding and by far the best chief I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. He was above all conscientious and a leader of men and had the ability to train the men under him. $kParagraphBreak I also had the finest reward of all; knowing that the men liked and respected me. On the Trever I was liked but I'm afraid not respected much. But on the Ozbourn I got both. I really believe that Laughlin was telling the truth that night when he told me that the men respected me more than any they had ever worked for. For one thing I never had to put one man on report or ever have to cuss about a job being done twice. It was the nicest feeling in the world to give an order and see it carried out with no fuss or strain. And the department was good. I took great pride in my engine rooms and fire rooms and I think that the men did too. They were always clean and in good repair and more than that they always showed signs of work being done and improvement going on. Strangely enough I think that the captain thought it was a pretty good job too. $kParagraphBreak On looking back I will say that I never worked harder in my life than I did on the 'O'. And I doubt if I will ever get more satisfaction than I did from the job. It was a job I loved with a bunch of men who couldn't be better and it was done to my satisfaction. I am forever greatful that I got that job and was thus able to prove to myself what I could do. I believe I learned more about men, machines, and engineering in these few months than at any other time in my life. I only hope that I will be able again to do such a job and again get such satisfaction. I liked the ship and I liked the job and the men liked me.''',

First I want to say I had a most enjoyable evening; much more pleasant than I anticipates, what with tension, uncertainty - mostly mine only - and possible strained circumstatnce. On the whole it was fun. Now looking back on thw whole thing I really don't feel as abdly as I thought I would, as a matter of fact I felt much worse about it last night thinking about what might have happened. Now that we have it all figured out I feel much better, I like knowing how I stand, the score and situation; uncertainty disturbs me. $kParagraphBreak My new course is clear, I have just checked over my old "wolf gear", fangs, roving eye, etc and am ready to go again - not that they've been stowed away too long. $kParagraphBreak Now as too the future; I do hope you won't mind my writing you, I feel that you really know me pretty well and I need someone to whom to write my gripes, groans, philosophies. It really is a great help to unload these things in writing and you make such a pleasant listener. Besides, you are a cousin, you know! $kParagraphBreak Well it was fun and worth every minute of it. My only regret is that this damn war prevented my having more time to see you; our compartment was wonderful but woefully small. However, that is now over - that compartment shut. Now enters the platonic chapter, relationship as it was meant to be, cousins. $kParagraphBreak I went into this affair with my head up and eyes open. My original idea was certainly anything but serious; somewhere along the line I got sort of involved but now it is disentangled and life returns to a more familiar pattern. I feel no jealousy; I knew it would end like this sometime but I had hoped at a later date. But who am I to direct time and tides. $kParagraphBreak Your cousin and a damn good loser''',

        '''$kTab The time has come for me to start considering the possibilities for a job when leaving Yale next spring. Now is a very good time to write upon my thoughts on jobs an occupations. If I can put my ideas down on paper concretely I will be much better off when I go around being interviewed this next year. $kParagraphBreak As I look at the subject now, I can see a definite ignorance about the types of jobs I am qualified for and are open to me. I may find too that after the comming years work I may not be so anxious to get a job in chemistry at all. As things stand now I'm quite sure I would prefer a job in some fairly large chemical concern or industry; plastics, petroleum, basic chemicals, dye, and numerous others. I think that I would prefer the organic field. I also have developed a great interest in engineering and plant operation during my sojourn in the navy which I would also like to include in my comming job. Then too there is the ever-present thrill attached to new development and research and that I would like to find in my work. To sum up; what I want is a job in organic chemistry which will require knowledge of engineering and which is continually advancing. $kParagraphBreak Now that we have this vague outline of an occupation there are many gaps that must be filled in. What kind of duties do I expect to preform? I naturally don't expect to start off in job which has a great deal of responsibility attached tey I do want some. I don't want to be just an auto-man who does the same thing over and over. In other words being a laboratory technician does not appeal to me, I want a job which is partially administrative. $kParagraphBreak I think the job which would come nearest meeting my requirements is a job as assistant plant, department or some unit manager in control of some chemical process; preferably in a development plant. I think at the present I would be better as a production man, or liaison man between research and development. A man who would need the background of a chemist and the practical experience of an engineer. The job I really want is not onw which I can expect jto get upon leaving college yet it is something I would like to strive for. $kParagraphBreak Actually I cannot tell at this time exactly what kind of job I can get or how I will like it but I do think that it will be for the best if I spend a considerable amount of time next year interviewing and talking to chemists in industry and there by getting a better idea od the possibilities. I once felt that the last thing I wanted in the navy was a job in engineering, perhaps my ideas on research and jobs will change also once I get into it. Only time will tell the truth. $kParagraphBreak As for Crane & Co; yes, I do intend to return at some future date, probably with in ten years. Mainly I will do this because I like Dalton and I would like to raise my family here. I also feel a certain amount of obligation and responsibility to the mills and once I have proved what I can do else where, I will return.''',

        '''$kTab It was as always wonderful to see you back in the Berkshires. I do hope you had a grand time. You really made the party for me and as far as I am concerned with you there the party was terrific; I only hope that everyone else enjoyed it as well. $kParagraphBreak I meant to call you before you left but as I failed to get up till 1030 I figured you had left, but Boo tells me you didn't go until 1100; I am very sorry I failed. $kParagraphBreak Bassett & Harvey left Friday noon but all the Kittredge crown was on hand for the dance Sat night. It was too bad you couldn't have stayed. I may go so far as to say that Pittsfield and environs has never been gamer then last week. Early and Seaman dropped in yesterday afternoon on the way back from the Bones picnic and said how sorry they were about missing the party. I think they all would have enjoyed the brawl more than spooking but I guess there wasn't anything they could do about it. Due to this I am now in a stew trying to get a cut-away for Early's wedding. It is to be Sept 7th and presumably very game. $kParagraphBreak My only regret concerning the whole affair is that I didn't see more of you. But as usual at these game functions you never do get much chance to see anyone. Somehow or other I got the impression on the picnic that you were a little provoked at me; I hope you weren't or if so you have since forgiven me. Thursday night I was really whipped and about as ungame as I've been in a long time; maybe that had something to do with it? I sure hope you are;t peeved because whether you know it or not I think and awful lot of you and I'd be very upset if you were. $kParagraphBreak From the latest dope we may not be going up to East Hampton this weekend as Pop is pretty pooed out after all the festivities and Mom thinks we ought to put it off. But I'll call you up from the Cape on Friday anyway. $kParagraphBreak We are all set for you to arrive on the 19th and stay as long as you can. I'll have all manner of things planned for you and not hat your jinx is broken I'm sure the weather will be fine. $kNewline See you soon. $kNewline$kNewline$kNewline$kNewline 22 July 1946 $kParagraphBreak I guess at this point I may as well go into a little discourse on Lou; though there really isn't a problem on that subject as far as I'm concerned. I suppose that at the moment I am more interested (in love if things were a little different) with her than I've been with any other girl since my old friend Gale back in '40/ the things I like about her are so apparent that there seems to be little point going into them, looks, charm, sincerety and a most wonderful smile. My only complaints, I wish she weren't so thin and just a little bit taller - but they are minor. $kParagraphBreak Up until Sunday I did have quite a problem because I fought with myself constantly, conscience and desire. Lucy was Moorehead's girl and Moorehead was my best friend. Every since last winter I have avoided every mentioning the subject of how we stood or how I felt because of this conflict; I did my best to keep from getting too interested. In consequence I've had about the most platonic romance that could be imagined. Whether my principles or tactics were right or wrong I don't know, but the issue I'm afraid is fairly well decided. I make a hell of a good runner-up. Somehow or another I seem to do very well in second place. Which isn't so hot. $kParagraphBreak The way Lucy told me did more than any to make her love me more. She really played the game square. Since there is nothing definate or final yet between she and the Head she could just as well kept me hanging around until things were settled; but no, she gave me all the inside dope in such a nice way that I have nothing but respect for her. $kParagraphBreak It will take me a few months or so to completely get rid of the effects of my unsuccessful campaign though most of the hurt will be gone by a few days. But it takes a couple of months to become reacclimated and during that time I expect to see Lucy fairly occasionally and see how things are going and make sure there is no other character trying to cut in on the Head. Its tough but not so bad as it might be. $kNewline$kNewline$kNewline$kNewline Here follows a letter: $kNewline$kNewline 21 July 1946 $kNewline Dearest Lou, $kParagraphBreak Many, many thanks for such a wonderful weekend. The Cape which always looks good to me looked ten times better because you were here, the sailing was better, the Freedom better, the dance better everything was better because I was completely satisfied just to have you around. Pretty fancy talk, I'll admit but straight from the shoulder in this case. Everyone was most impressed with you and my prestige soared tremendously and every one was most supprised to see the "Big Smooch" could find anyone so nice as you. Mom's comment after you left was, "too bad Lucy couldn't stay longer as I've never seen you act so nice and sweet; I really think its unfair, you should act natural sometime just to warn her how you really are." Anyway Lou it was wonderful, tops in a long succession of wonderful weekends. $kParagraphBreak I do want to thank you so much for telling me all that you did Sunday night; I really appreciate it, first because it really showed how much you really think of me and secondly because it is better for me. One thing I also want to say is how much I admire your courage in telling me a thing which I know is not an easy thing to do and which so many girls would not have done. It is much better this way because now we all know where we stand and everything is out in the open, also I can not tell you things which I have always avoided before but now I'll tell you just once. $kParagraphBreak This is the first real love letter I've ver written and I trust the last because I never say things like this except under times of emotional stress when I am usually summing up all the things I've thought about but never said. I'll just say this once because after that it loses by repetition and does not help the situation at all. Keep this letter and sometimes when you get blue you can look it over and remember that there was one guy who loved you an awful lot in a sort of peculiar way, and maybe it will make you feel better. Remember once I told you I was scared f falling in love because I was afraid of getting hurt, well I might add I fought it hard all winter and all the way to Cuba and back then I just said to hell with it; I was licked. And I might also say it was the most damned unselfish love I ever got involved in, which at the present time is a very good thing. I really didn't want anything more than just to be with you. I'll never forget any of those weekends. I often wondered if you knew just how much you meant to me since I had never said anything or given much more than a hint, but it was there though I hated to admit it to myself. To tell you the truth I guess I'd just as soon get singed a bit as hurt the Head because that would bother me a lot too. In finishing up I will say that I don't regret any of it a bit and would do the same thing over again and in the same way. $kParagraphBreak Now before you burt into tears over the sad plight of F. Crane I will tell you that I have found myself to be a man of remarkable resilience and that I bounce back on two feet in no time. In fact before you even see me again my wolf fangs will be sharpened and the roving lecherous eye will be again searching the surroundings for likely prospects, and Crane will be game again; again he will be know as the Dalton Devil. So don't be to sorry for me. Now you see it was much better to tell me, n'est-ce pas. I will be engaged in wolf patrol activities for the next three or four months during which timeI will ever keep a watchful eye on my Lucy to see that she is not becoming involved in unfortunate directions. $kParagraphBreak Again I say many thanks for everything and I mean the works. I will never regret a minute of it they were all wonderful. Just remember Lou that I think you are the most wonderful girl there ever was and my only worry is where will I ever find another girl to live up to your specifications. You have a friend for life and if you ever need help just give a yell in my direction and I'll come running. $kParagraphBreak My best to the Head and say the only way he can redeem himself for failure to get to Dalton is to get to Wianno. $kNewline$kTab All my love $kNewline P.s. I will want to see you gain five pounds - remember the milk. $kNewline$kNewline$kNewline$kNewline 29 July $kParagraphBreak I will make just a few more remarks about my love-life then I'll quit until something important occurs. This book is not for the sole purpose of discussing the loves of F. Crane. But to sort of wind this thing all up I'll say that my analysis of my reactions was pretty good. At the end of one week my outlook on life has improved 100% and the sharp pain has gone. I must admit that I did feel pretty bad for a week and it did hurt like the devil, I seem to suffer considerably for a short time, get down in the month, be rather disagreeable, and worst of all lose my sence of humor. But now that stage is over; with Coz B it only lasted three days. $kParagraphBreak Now the second stage has set in on which there is no time limit; it is a gradual return to normal. being my own naturally good humored self except not quite as game and my ego slightly deflated. $kParagraphBreak Since Lou is not definately out of the picture I will continue to hand around and make an effort for a couple of months more if the strain does not prove too great. My coming visit will determine that. And during this time I will fall back more and more on my reserves trying to increase them at all times. $kParagraphBreak As reserves at the present there are only two Sally & Lib; only one of whom will do much good since Lib will be away. As I see it the time is ripe for me to stir up a few more name for this list. It is unfortunate that Lib won't be around since I know she has a very soft spot for me and I feel that my ego could deinately take a little building up right now and Lib is the girl who could do it. Perhaps it is just as well since my intentions would not be of the best as I don't intend to become so interested for sometime and Lib might be hurt. As for Sally, I haven't seen her in such a long time I hardly know, but time will tell.''',

        '''$kTab To me there is no place on earth that I would rather spend most of my life than Dalton. I suppose it is only natural that I should feel this way since it is home to me but I do think I feel more strongly about it than most people. Why this is so is harder to explain than you might suppose. There are many obvious reasons of course and a few that aren't so apparent. Dalton is certainly a beautiful town, nestled in the Berkshires, with grand old elms and maples in abundance, nice comfortable houses, a typical New England town. There is a great feeling of space for no one is crowded; one always had the feeling that there is plenty of room. And above all nature is always so predominant. One never has to go more than a few hundred to find himself perfectly alone in the heart of nature; woods, fields, and hills surround the town. Beautiful and roomy surrounding always have an effect on me akin to religion. Somehow I feel better, act better and am better when in this sort of environment. I love farms and working in soil, watching things grow, seeing cattle and horses grazing. It is all here. Skiing and skating are excellent in the winter and nearly all the summer sports are available. In short Dalton is grand for the outdoor man. $kParagraphBreak One of the best things of all about our community is the people who make it up. I have never seen a nicer bunch; not that they are terribly exciting or interesting but it is there way of life. There is none of the fast society set with its resulting divorces, intrigues, too much drinking, or too much loving. The older group and the young set believe in the old fashioned ideals of marriage and I'm sure nearly all practice it. To one the atmosphere is so much healthier here than in most of the places I have visited. Particularly for the teenagers it is better; for they all have other interests as well as girls & liquor. But people aren't stuffy here; they enjoy life to my way of thinking far more than most people. No group could be more hospitable or friendly or for that matter more tolerant. This is where I want to bring up my children. Also Dalton is a tradition with me, for six generations the Cranes lived here and now they have become an integral part of the town. Dalton is dependant on the Cranes and they upon Dalton. It is quite a challenge for me to live up to the reputation and respect which my forbearers have accrued and too live up to the responsibility to which I will fall heir. $kParagraphBreak With all this one might ask why do I wish to leave Dalton and seek work elsewhere. It is quite simple; I hope to work someplace people will not care whether I am Crane or Jone nor where my every move will be watched. I want to move a way for a while to gain experience and to an extent freedom from my obligations here but always with the idea of some day returning. When I have established a family and my own confidence and reputation I will return. ''',

        '''$kTab Due to a few new experiences in sex and thinking I have arrived a quite a few number of new conclustions; not all of them to different from ones I had previously held, but perhaps a few new connotations, new only to myself. These ideas pertain mainly to intimate relations with the opposite sex, broadly speaking, and the structure of women. $kParagraphBreak Having always had a rather idylic conception of the relation I might have witha woman whom I liked an yet was sleeping with, I have come to the possibility that it may not be what I've always thought it might be. Unfortunately it seems to be impossible to realize the perfectly 'platonic', unencumbered relations with a female you are sleeping with. It seems that either it becomes progressively an anticlimaxtic or it leads to love. One cannot be in such close contact with another person and maintain a perfectly rational equilibrium; it cannot remain static. $kParagraphBreak All my recent experiences have been based on Janet White and I think she is a girl worth of discussion. Of course my first reaction to her was at Pam's party in Dalton where she excelled by being the gamest girl there. Naturally when Lucy began to show signs of drifting away, I turned toward the nearest girl who was prospectively game, so I turned toward Jan, whom I really didn't know at all and yet was sure she would be perfect for rebuilding my ego. The first time I kissed her or necked with her which was a consciderable time after I'd frist taken her out, only went to bear out my original idea that she was pretty game and would unquestioningly be good for me at the time. That was the time when she and I recognized the reserves. It was merely an excuse for having some girl be nice to me inorder to build up my own ego. $kParagraphBreak Anyway time went on and I was at college and I thought that Hanet would be a good girl to keep around because I really enjoyed her company and I was able to neck successfully with her to satisfy a certain desire; plus the ...

        '''$kTab This is going to be the most difficult thing I've ever done and is going to sound very poor to you; so I'll say it fast and then try to explain. I want to cancel our plans for engagement and marriage; I don't want to go through with it. $kParagraphBreak After saying something like that I don't think explanations or reasons will make much difference, but I must give them if only to ease my own mind and conscience. you must understand that this is no sudden whim or passing emotion; I have thought about it for a long time and it has been working on me so much that I must say it. It is going to be difficult to put my reasoning into words, since I have difficulty explaining it to myself. My principle reason is that I sincerely believe that our marriage would not be a success and we would not be happy in the long run, and it would be mainly my fault. I am not concerned over the first year but it would be in the ensuing years that I think troubles would arise. Our love has been based on common physical likes and dislikes and not on common mental and ideological grounds. As you well know we deviate widely on much of our thinking and beliefs. While the physical remains very important in the early years all will be fine, but as that gradually receeds in importance and out mental and spiritual attractions should become important, we will grow further & further apart with unhappiness as a result. $kParagraphBreak I need to be disciplined or "beat on" frequently to keep me in line and to bring out the best in me. But in order for me to take this critisim kindly or to have it effective, it must come from someone whose will and philosophy I admire and respect. I have the feeling that I would not accept some of you critisim too well, because I'm afraid there are some places where my admiration and respect of you do not carry. These places are the very places where I need guidance the most. In other words though we are in many ways different our faults lie in the same place and tend to accentuate one another rather than minimizing each other. I am rather naturally selfish but in many ways you make me more self-centered and thoughtless of others rather than counter-acting this. I have been much more self centered with respect to you than an one I know and I can't seem to help myself. This is very bad in itself since marriage must be so unselfish. $kParagraphBreak Actually all of this is rationalization to explain an under-lying feeling. Ever since Christmas I have been very unhappy at heart; I have had a guilt-complex which I could not shake. I have felt that I was going in a direction I knew was wrong and yet was not strong enough to change it. It has kept bothering me; I had hoped to get rid of it but couldn't. It is a deep feeling and finally it has reached the surface. you may have noticed this feeling when it expressed itself in my lack of excitement and happiness at our telling the families, and you have heard me talk of some hidden unexplainable feeling. $kParagraphBreak Three times I've tried to tell you that I felt we were wrong and that I was unhappy about it, and each time I couldn't; the closest I ever came was that time at Tatnack over Christmas. I was going to tell you this time in Worcester but Jan, I can never tell you when I'm near you. That is why I'm doing it this way. I suppose it is cowardly and weak not to say this to your face but to write it is the only way I can tell you and to be happy ever I must get this out of my system. The reason being that I am in love with you when I'm with you; but when I'm away from you, and the desire aroused by your nearness and the other physical emotions you excite in me are dormant, then I am not in love. The moment I am away from the attention of your presence, the quieter emotions are felt; love, respect, admiration, and intellectual curiosity; and these Jan, I don't feel as I should and make me upset. My conscience has not let me have a minutes rest when I'm out here away from you. With you my conscience is completely overpowered and pacified by my attraction for you. But what can I do; I must be true to myself; I must say no to us. $kParagraphBreak You should feel very happy in a way that you are not marrying a man so weak and indecisive that he waits until the last minute before making up his mind. I can never as that you forgive me for the pain and anxiety I have caused you. I can never forgive myself for that. Jan as I once predicted it would be, writing this is like cutting out a part of me. I can't imagine what I'll be like without you but I must. $kParagraphBreak I don't see how it could work feeling the way I do and I'm sure the best thing is to call it all off, and the sooner the easier it will be. You can answer or not as yo wish; I would apriciate some word from you. $kParagraphBreak$kTab I can say no more. $kParagraphBreak$kTab$kTab Fred

        '''$kTab Strangely enough prior to the war, during it, and even the period directly following, I was pretty well adjusted to myself, and the morals and customs surrounding me. The adjustment or balance was very probably due to my naivatee and inexperience. The problem I am in particularly discussing is sex morals. Up until I met Jan White my experience with the opposite sex was pretty limited despite my big talk and exaggerated claims. Until then I had always thought, as I was taught to believe, the "nice girls" were somewhat different to men and that the girls one would consider marrying were of course virgins. ThoughI had played around, made my attempts and had a few successes with girls of rather shady character and heard of and had some slight success with a few supposedly "nice girls" I still instinctively clung to the Victorian idea that girls you marry must be "untouched". Perhaps this is somewhat of an exaggeration perhaps it would be better to say that while one side of me was perfectly conscious of reality my inborn moris would not accept it. I was well adjusted because this latent conflict had never been brought to a head. $kParagraphBreak Early in the winter of 1947 when I began finding myself falling in love with Janet this conflict began to be felt and has bothered me increasingly ever since. It was of course of of the major reasons for breaking engagement to her in March and the ensuing bitterness ever since. I am afraid that in many respects I was hypocritical in my lectures to her, for often enough I said that I expected no more from her in the way of sex morals than I I myself, yet in the end I could not live up to it. I agreed that women have the same basic desired as men and that our social standards were false and unfair. I tried to discriminate between a right or moral sexual relation and immoral one I managed to think up many mental dodges but none of them really impressed my subconscious principles. To this day, though, I will maintain that it was not the sexual relationship between she and I that caused its undoing but the relationships she had with men prior to me. $kParagraphBreak Now this problem is again presented in the form of Des Cognets; she is also a girl with a past and even more experience than Jan. I have a great respect for Betty in nearly all ways that I have encountered so far. She is intellegent, rational, curious and analytical. Her mental processed are much more akin to mine than Jan's and I can understand and respecter her more. Though I have not pressed her too deeply one her past, from what little I know I respect her more for it that I ever did Jan. But were I to find myself falling in love with her I would again be very troubled with the same old problem and again I would find that I lost faith in her because of it. $kParagraphBreak Why is this? By logic and biology I can argue all night why women are entitled to as much freedom as men and why are moral standards are a farce and delusion. I cannot answer fully the question, why should someone else having had her make her less for you? It all seems to point directly to early instillment of a standard which I can't shake plus a very prominent and unshakable male pride. Being a mildly egotistical extrovert, I like to feel that I'm just a little bit better than some other guy and don't wish to share all with him. And I think that possibly the slight frustration with sex in my earlier days adn to a certain extent still, I am very sensitive when it comes to prowess with girls. I hate to admit it but I have a very strong tendency toward jealousy and this also seems to support my pride. Granting all this and more; what is to be done about it. The number of virgins in the world of the appriate age and qualifications is rapidly diminishing and the ones that I know had had find at all appealing are nearly extinct. I must either find on of these rare creatures or change my standards. A difficult and gloomy choice!''',

        '''$kTab "This above all, unto thine ownself be true." ${kNewline}I suppose that that one line states better than all that follows a belief in life which I have always had. Up until recently it has always been a somewhat nebulous belief and not too clearly understood; understood so poorly by be that its meaning and connotations in many cases escaped me. Never before had I understood the individualistic and egotistical implications of that quote. Previously I had always emphasized the importance of the word true, feeling that it carried the weight and moral philosophy in that quote; but now I find that the truth is nothing without the essential term "ownself"! $kParagraphBreak "Because there is no God $kLongDash", to use another quote (Maxwell Anderson), therefore I have nothing else to believe in but myself. Since I cannot find strength nor courage from an outside source, I must find it from with in, and I have nothing to draw on but myself. Though I have often thought that it would be a great aid many times to have a faith and trust upon which one could lean in times of weakness; I have never found one upon which I could really lean and get any real help. I have never found religion to be of any use to me because I do not have the faith and nothing in it has yet convinced me enough so that I can put any faith it. People, family, etc can serve as guides and in some cases inspiration but yet the strength must come from me alone and not second hand from another. Thus I have no faith in anything but myself and since one needs a strong faith, I must have a strong one in myself. $kParagraphBreak The first quote now becomes obvious in its connotations. In order for this faith to be strong one must be true. Once you have realized what it is to be untrue to yourself and therefore shattering the only faith one has there can be no question but that you must be true. It is impossible to try to hide the truth from yourself; you can try all kinds of devices and tricks, rationalization and escapism but you cannot hide it, and your faith is lessened in each attempt. One must be his own best critic and the only one of importance. Since tru happiness is purely the feelings of an individual; it can only be derived from your appraisal of your own actions or thoughts and not from others appraisal of you. $kParagraphBreak The best example of the ideal carried I'm sure much beyond the power od mortal man is Howard Roork in "Fountainhead". I cannot begin to follow his footsteps but he does set up certain goals which I would like to strive for. $kParagraphBreak The basic problem comes in understanding what you want and what your motives and desires are, then live up to your own standards which you have set to the best of your ability, Then do as you know you should do (or must) and be damned to what others think of you. The most important thing is being and individual, yourself, and not a second-hander, a member of a herd.''',

        '''$kTab Miss Joyce - It was as usual most pleasant to see you this weekend; I really mean it when I say I had a delightful time and loved being with you - despite your ill humor. Actually I have nothing to complain about since you were very nice to me and gave me a very good time. Strange as it may seem to you, I always have fun with you and it is always a pleasure to see you. I'll admit sometimes more so than others, but none theless always nice for me. $kParagraphBreak I am only sorry that you are in a bit of a gloom right now. (This is about to be a long winded letter, I've had a few martinis, but bear with me). I'm sure you are familiar with that common beat the "make ego", I must say I am by no means lacking it yet I'm sure that you must see that my present position is perhaps no well suited to building it or supporting it. This is all too true yet I have found ways of compensating it. If I can feel that I am doing something to help you or make you a better or happier person my little ego can be stilled, but it is dependant on that. Thus you can see why your attitude and feelings are so important to me. All I really ask is that I can help you a little in any way. $kParagraphBreak You say that you are dissatisfied with yourself etc, and that no one can help you but yourself; this is mainly true, but there are such things as a helping hand & a crutch. And these I am only to willing to offer to the best of my ability. Just remember, Miss Joyce, that I think very highly of you and when things look glum just think that I am honestly pay you the highest compliment I can offer "merry me". I hate to see anyone I think that much of feel badly about themselves, I might be inclined to lose faith in my own judgement. And kind Joycie, when you need a crutch to push you into doing something you should, just think of how much it will please me to have you do, and how much it would mean to me to know that I had helped you do something. $kParagraphBreak You say I'm a fool to be in love with you but I'm not. I'm getting much more out of it that you, because you are giving me a reason for doing things and a person to share enjoyment with. Even thought our motive are slightly different it would be a great help for you to try to get the same feeling across to you. I'm only sorry I'm not to right one for you so that it would be easier to do; but I shall try to make the best of the situation. I used this suggestion because you are a kind person and it is easy for you to be affectionate to others and thus try to show how much affection you can give me by doing those things you think you should. Try to make that affection a bit more than just a temporary thing. $kParagraphBreak And now for another subject, the 4th; I realize that it is a slim chance but if you should get Monday of or could take it, you would be most welcome here. You know there will be no interference from the wedding and that all would be delighted to see you. There is no possible chance of my asking anyone else for that weekend so feel free to announce it all at the last minute if you can come. Washington may be awfully hot at that time and Dalton rather pleasant so do try!''',

        '''$kTab Dearest Joice, $kParagraphBreak Well you certainly are back to your old self again. What do you need something new every minute - as soon as the house & job get old you go back into the doldrums again. $kParagraphBreak If you have no news at least I have and most encouraging. I seem to be making some progress at Crane & Co and I am definitely going to to be working on improvement of currency paper. This will be fine since I'll be left pretty much on my own and will at least be doing something constructive. My many ideas for improving Crane & Co's research program have faired much better than I expected, several being quite strongly in favor of them, Bruce for one, so there may be quite a few changes within the year. All of this is extremely pleasing to me and has improved my moral and outlook on life in Dalton. $kParagraphBreak My little house is moving slowly due to the present occupants but I am hoping that something will break soon. I have many ideas and I can't wait to put them into action. Though I haven't seen Donny yet rumor has it that he is most willing to move in with me. $kParagraphBreak I am quite boyed[?] up about buying a plane and think I have a chance for the same one I flew down to Wash in. If I can get it for the right price I think it would be a good bym being in good shape without too much time on it. So the next time you hear from me I may be an owner. $kParagraphBreak Last weekend I went down to the Cape and had a delightful time. The weather was excellent and we had much sailing and tennis. Jim and Marge were there with their small one who looks just like Jim - not the prettiest child but very cute. I think it was the struggle with the traffic going down more than anything else that has convinced me of the need for a better mode of transportation, and the prospect of facing it all again this weekend is tempting me to go right out and get a plane tomorrow. $kParagraphBreak Gib, Jean, Donny etc are all going down to out house for our annual house-party which should be most pleasant - except for to long drive to and from. I'm very sorry you and Pam won't be with us and I shall miss you very much. $kParagraphBreak I heard from Pam that the supper party was a great success and that you did quite a job on Garner - Miss Joicie[?] at work (that type) is always a pleasure to contemplate. $kParagraphBreak Joie dear, at times like these I think what you want most is affection, and you know that I am only too willing to comply but sometimes you make it awfully difficult. I try my hardest but I feel sometimes it is quite inadequate, but admittedly it is difficult to do onesided at a distance. $kParagraphBreak Anyway my very best to all in Wash ans I'll be down to see you in "my plane" soon, I hope, if you like. $kParagraphBreak All my love to you $kLongDash $kParagraphBreak Affectionately $kParagraphBreak$kDoubleNewline Fred''',

        '''$kTab I suppose I am angry with you because you have caused the fall of another of my castles and so I must speak my piece in order to salvage at least some respect in my judgement. $kParagraphBreak When I first went tumbling into your lap you were an almost perfect answer to my prayer, not perfect because you wouldn't tumble back; but nonetheless as I have explained many times you did well enough and kept me very contented. Your affection, discipline, and appreciation of my sex appeal did a lot to restore my ego an self confidence. Because you did so much for me I have casually, naturally turned to you in time of need. This time I looked and knew you wouldn't be there. $kParagraphBreak Last night I sat down to write you a letter because I was having a moment of indecision and wanted to have someone to discuss it with. It was about the national crisis and what my feelings and actions should be. I started the letter to you - naturally turning to the person I felt closest too - and the letter went to Pam. $kParagraphBreak You see Joice in a time of crisis like that, you turn to someone for strength and guidance and it is only a person very close to whom you can turn. Sex and momentary affection don't pay off at such a time. You say that what I was asking for you couldn't give, love; but I say that's not the whole story. Love is wonderful but its a couple of the things that make it up that I wanted and could find in a person I'm not in love with. $kParagraphBreak Before one can show that much of oneself to anyother you must be sure of two things, true affection and an honest attempt to understand. Your affection has always been momentary and I have never seen you display what I term true affection. A caress, a conversational or assumed interest, a note of respect, a token of appreciation, all are the outward signs of affection. $kParagraphBreak You pride yourself on being affectionate and every one of those outward manners you have to high degree - but whats under it? It's not the outward signs that are affection, its the motivating force and what is yours? Why do your outward gestures fail over a distance or over a period of time. Why the lack of a feeling of responsibility? - No motivation, no affection,. Analyze it yourself and see. From an outward sense your perfect and only so can you get away with so much lack of effort. This will work in most cases but you for anyone in love with you or for any man considering you as a wife. $kParagraphBreak The other point, an honest attempt to understand me, is also pertinent. I know that it is really impossible to understand another, but the attempt is most important. Here again you show all the outward signs of interest and are interested in all the surface things. But what about underneath. A hundred times I've hoped you'd ask me what ticked under my skin and a hundred times I've tried to give all of me but no result, no interest. You can't give it and so you won't accept it. Janet was like that only at least she tried and she could accept it. $kParagraphBreak I don't know why I tell you this, maybe others have told you - maybe they haven't but some one should. Maybe thats why I could say to myself though I'm very in love I'll never marry you. So now Miss J you can have what you've said you wanted, sex and no responsibilities.  ''',

        '''$kTab Although for the moment the international situation is not as bad as it first appeared it is still extremely bleak. Russia's objective is all too apparent; the destruction of the only obstacle in her path to world domination, the U.S.A. She apparently does not want an open fight if it can be avoided, but it is obvious that she is not scared of us and will not go too dar to avoid it. We evidently have a few months breathing spell and if we arm sufficiently we may have more. But arm we must and to the full extent of our resources. We have gone much too slowly and the worst comment on our present state of instability is that I have any decision to make. I and all like me should have been called or told that we would be called long ago. We should have mobilized immediately when the Reds first stepped across the Manchurian boarder. $kParagraphBreak Feeling as strongly as I do that we should be filly mobilized at the moment, leaves me with a very strong moral pressure to go. Also looking at it slightly longer range view, I see no way in which some kind of struggle can be avoided for long. There is room for only one of us on this earth and either we oe they will dominate. From every one of Russia's actions we can see that from her point of view she must remove us and to prevent it we must be strong. The struggle must come within the next two years and very probably much sooner - a matter of months. This leaves me feeling that my existance as present is really quite useless. Seeing this struggle coming I should be preparing myself to do all I can to prepare myself for it. Instead of making paper I should be practicing how to be a better officer. $kParagraphBreak Then there is the feeling of the futility of working as if nothing were going to happen. What is the use of being a better paper-maker when what is needed is a better naval officer. It becomes very frustrating to plan and work toward various goals only to know that you cannot even see them well on their way and worse to see the importance of those goals vanish in a war. $kParagraphBreak To get to a more practical side, what is a matter of a few months anyway. If I were married those few months might be very important but I'm not. The few months of my present life left to me are not worth it, if I can be of service elsewhere. And if by going in now I can take more active and successful part in the approaching war, the sacrifice was well worth it.''',

        '''$kTab It is easy to see that my praise and flattery were much too premature and that without further ado you have sunk to your old self again. I must admit that my flattery was spoken by way of encouragement for a good beginning but without much faith in in its continuance and I see my lack of confidence is justified. You certainly show your true colors - a bit of ardent effort, discouragement and then complacence - right back where you started. $kParagraphBreak Joycie it is easy to see that you have no understanding of the word perseverance or the theory that a certain amount of continuous effort is the only way of accomplishing anything. This lack of perseverance runs through your whole character and to my way of thinking accounts for ninethenths of its short comings. Start with athletics, tennis skiing or golf - your lack of coordination never defeated you but merely the complete failure to try and try until you have beaten it and your own self (that tendance to quit when discouraged). This lack of coordination is merely an alibi to sooth your ego and protect your self respect. In every case where it is essentially a lack of true effort you always manufacture some nice reason why you are incapable. Look at this crape about being a dull person and not a brilliant wit conversationally - nuts - thats merely an alibi for the times when you just can't quite put out the effort to be yourself. If something doesn't come easily you withdraw into a little shell and then invent some nice fault so that you can indulge in some nice self criticism. $kParagraphBreak What always seems to go along with the lack of perseverance but lack of courage as well. So so often cobel[?] this no self-confidence but my positive little friend, you and I both know you really have plenty of that in every way except where it is actually doing something other than just talking, a lack of confidence. We have talked about your hard impersonal shell. It is merely a protective device to cover your lack of courage and perseverance (jointly guts). You hide behind this shell when you haven't the courage to expose your inner self and because you're afraid you may hurt yourself by your inability to really do a job. $kParagraphBreak Lack of self confidence, lack of guts, which causes which I don't know, but I do know that its only the courage and perseverance which will give you faith in yourself. You are your wont worst critic and most ineffective. You do the criticizing so that on one else will and thus you can deflect the fire to something less tender within you. It won't work! $kParagraphBreak You've got to try and try now because the older you get the harder it will be. What do you want in life, a husband, home & family but look at yourself; by your own admission a lousy risk. And essentially why? Coldness, no; selfishness, not really; but just a complacent lack of effort, and a withdrawal into yourself at the slightest fear of being hurt. We both know why that would make a wretched marriage companion. $kParagraphBreak All I want to impress on you is the need for Trying; just making an effort. This doesn't have to be any special effort in any particular direction but in everything, work, athletics, your relations with others and particularly your self. Your self discipline exercises and your lental[?] sacrifices were good. But mainly just keep trying. ''',

        '''$kTab The relationship - very physical (of primary importance) with considerable affection shown which is good for us both. Relations well established, likes & dislikes well known to each, much common experience and pleasure behind us. $kParagraphBreak PROS - There is no question but that the relationship has certain strong advantages for us both. On the physical side alone we both need and require it and it is nice to have someone to turn to for that release and pleasure. Both of us being rather affectionate by nature we both need some one to whom to spend our affection and also need someone to give it to use. This part is by no means an equal distribution over the long run but of the short term it is. We bot excercise a certain good and needed disciplinary effect over each other and I like to feel we have contributed to building up & bolstering certain good characteristics in both of us. Also we are congenial, compatable, and do have a great deal of fun together. Actually almost everything essential is there to make a happy marriage and there is a possibility that such might be the eventual outcome. $kParagraphBreak CONS - The essential and most important failure in the whole relationship is that Joyce does not love me. Thought I believe that she is much closer too it than she actually thinks, there are still many signs that there is a long wat to go for her. Her feelings for me are essentially stated above which are the essentials for love but just don't seem to be carried far enough in Joyce's case. Her affection is strictly short term and of the moment with very little lasting quality to it and her prime emotion as far as I'm concerned is physical. My feelings are deeper and I can honestly say there are many times when I would have been and was utterly in love, but that is wearing thin now. I still could be in love if I sincerely thought it was recipricated and if I thought I could really exert a real discipling influence on her. I want her and I need her but not to the extent I previously did. $kParagraphBreak Further argument against it is that as things stand now the raod is only down hill. The best has been - not "yet to be". I guess I'm old fashioned but there is something that has to accompany pure physical pleasure in order to give real satisfaction. That has been and under the present set up that something will become less and less and our relationship will become more and more degrading to both of us. So far most of the giving has come form me and as that lessens as it is bound to do unless there is some stimulation, the affectionate side of this will become more and more meaningless, with the accompanying debasing of the act and our selves. $kParagraphBreak The third reason for my feeling against continuing is Joyce's moral feeling about this whole thing. I can not really understand her view point or if I understand it I don't like it. So lone as it could be justified by a strong possibility of love and very strong affection I could justify it in my mind and still respect her for it. But as this thing goes on and less and less comes of it I cannot continue to hold respect for her. So that from now on she degrades in my eyes. And she does degrade rather badly when I add this to some of the things she likes to say about herself which I have never really believed. $kParagraphBreak CONCLUSION - I must drop this relationship now in order to maintain my self-respect (important above all I have found) and in order to keep a few good happy memories of the affair. I cannot go through another J.W. affair and I cannot let this fold slowly of its own weight. It must stop now quick and be frozen at its best rather than at its bottom. Also it may do Joyce some considerable good and perhaps awake in her some healthy and worthwhile feeling.''',

        '''$kTab I wouldn't count on too much correspondance from me in the future because as I said it is too hard for me to switch from one role to another. Things being as they are I've just got to get used to forgetting about you. $kParagraphBreak For this reason I'd like to get in my last session of lecturing since I won't have another chance. If you want to keep from the miseries of self condemnation you've got to learn to live with yourself and your world - neither are perfect. You are too critical or expect too much of both yourself and others; your goals are not necessarily too high but your adjustment to the inadaquacies of others & yourself is at fault. I say, Joyce, that for you to be happy you've got to learn to pick the essential and important from the trivial and bear down on those that are important - this foes for you and others. $kParagraphBreak As you are now you are just as strong on your critisim of small things as on big things & thus the effect is lessened. As a consequence you spend a deal of time in critisizing yourself on minor matters and overlook the important ones. It is good for you to be living with Betsy as she is one of the best examples of a person who can immediately know what is important to her and what isn't. She, as far as I've seen, has never been bogged down by small items and as a consequence is a very well adjusted person. - you are not. Self critisim is a good thing when it is effective and to keep it effective it must be used sparingly otherwise you just [restrict] yourself to critisism of others and lose your oen confidence - an unhappy state. $kParagraphBreak Another item which I have harped on before is effort. You've got to learn to be a fighter and to make yourself do things. In general things have been pretty easy for you but it isn't so now, you've got to exert yourself. You've got to exert yourself for others and accept responsibility which others thrust on you. By this I mean things like the old subject of letters as well as exerting yourself to see and like people. This sounds [funny] coming from me since you were about to critisize me on the same subject. But out situations are much different; with me it is the exterior that is a fault, with you the interior. Your social graces are excellent, conversationally, looks, charm, and all but it is all exterior and there is nothing of yourself really in it. You can accept from others but you really give very little of yourself. Until you know someone very intimately you give a person very little that is under that shell of yours. That Joie, is why you mutter and [accuse] yourself for being anti-social and why you say that sex must be entered into before you can relax with a man. That is bad and you can only overcome it by making a consiencous effort to give. This is nothing more than the same old story of affection that I've always harped on. To give you must put something of yourself into it - not just surface fixtures. $kParagraphBreak And now to the third thing - sex. I don't think you should have another affair such as ours, since I think it would be very bad for you. In the first place you must learn to give without sex and before it and more important it is degrading. Its the old case of where do you draw the line; where does promiscuity begin and need & friendliness end. No, Joie I think you should leave it alone for a long time and use a little self control (it would be good for you). As the old saying goes, if there's enough love to make it right then you should marry him - otherwise its wrong. That statement just about covers my belief on the subject and is one reason it has been so hard for me to understand our relationship. And it is why I've wanted so desperately to find some expressed emotion from you to make it right. No on can really say or be much help on this subject - its up to you, but I would advise staying away from it because I'm afraid that sex more than anything could turn you into a very hard person. $kParagraphBreak And now I just want to say Joie, that you have, and at the moment still do, mean more to me than anyone ever has. I have a great deal to be thankful for despite my feelings. Considering the situation you have been very good to me and have kept hurt to a minimum. My plan has always been to try to make you so dependent on me that you couldn't leave but I see that more than just dependancy is needed and my plan has failed. You've got to find something which will make you do those things yourself. You would no longer be the old independant Joie, if you had to depend constantly on someone and I wouldn't love you for long. Don't count on a "Mr Right" because it won't work that way & he doesn't exist. Mr Right will come when you've got things fixed with yourself and are ready for him.''',
