        '''Dear Pop, $sep I have gone into A.G.C I hope you like that. I didn't do it on your account however. Hobe, Early and Red and all the best fellows went there, about 19. I guess that will practically pull the house out of the hole. $sep I wish you would send me some writing paper. As you may have noticed this is not mine but some that Wick left. I would like some the same as last time. $sep I am playing football on the Jay Vees, I was on the varsity for a while but I got cut. I am playing first team so far. I hope I can keep it up. $sep Tell Mom that my room is as neas as a pin. It is so big I can put stuff under the couch and it is not noticed. The old couch broke so we are using Red's which is fine. $sep Tell Jim I am sorry I didn't go P.A.E. and that Tim Hoopes is awful sore; they only got 4. $sep $tb $tb Lots of love, $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred

        '''Dear Pop, $sep I was swell being home last weekend but it was too bad I had to leave so early. It is very hard getting back to work again after getting out of here for awhile. I', now right in the midst of mid-term exams; I took my French test yesterday and I'm not sure that I did very well on it. If I fail it I will start tutoring for the rest of the term, other wise I'll let it go. $sep Everyone is working to get the house fixed up for reunion. I think there are eleven or twelve coming back so far. I got a letter from Mac. today which said he was going to be here for the 10th. It will be good to see him again. Tell me what time you are coming. $sep I hope Mom got off to Buffallo OR because I think she needs a rest. She looked quite tired and rundown after taking care of so many sick kids. I hope no one else has gotten the mumps. $sep When are you going to take the Freedom out this year? I would certainly like to go for a sail some time soon. Its going to be quite awhile before I'll be able to, i guess. By the way I'll be able to get to New London in plenty of time to go in that race to Hampton Roads; my last   [boend?] is on Friday morning. (thats a little hint.) $sep There is very little excitement to tell you about - no money trouble yet or anything else. Hope to see you soon. $sep $tb $tb Love, $nl $tb $tb Fred

        '''Dear Admiral, $sep We are now in port after a very calm voyage in which most of the middies go sicker than dogs. Dicken and I however were in very good shape and watched the others look for mermaids. After they go their sea legs, Jim and I were hoping that it would get rough so that we could get enough to eat without fighting for it as we did the first few days out. $sep I have been working in the black gang all the way down. Its been quite interesting but I spent most of the time painting. It seems that's all they do on this ship is paint -- they paint it all over then scrape it off and paint again. You would like this ship because she is really clean and in beautiful shape. The skipper makes the boys work and keep her in shape. Which is more than I can say for some of the ships that the other boys are on. The corvette Moorhead is on is in really sad shape. $sep We have been getting quite a bit of training. We have to take a lot of sun and star sights, and the boys on the bridge have been plotting etc; also acting as assistant quartermasters. We have had lectures on gunnery "etc" and navigation all very usefull. Also a talk about health in "liberty ports". I can't tell you all the interesting details I guess for quite a while. $sep We are down where its fairly hot but I haven't gotten much a burn because of my black gang work but I will be topside on the way back. Dicken is very sore because his face peels every two days. He is looking sort of diseased. $sep This is the same old ship that we've seen before but she's a good ship. $sep I trust you've located your ship, see that she's being built OK. $sep Well I hope to see you sometime but don't know when. $sep $tb $tb Lots of love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred $sep F.G.

        '''Dear Pop, $sep We had a fine cruise to Guantanimo Cuba. We had a little excitement on the way; going down we picked up a contact and drop some charges right off the stern something popped out of the water so we opened up with everything and it turned out to be a mast on a wreck and anticlimax but it gave us some excitement; on the way back we dropped some 40 cans and were at general quarters all night but I don't think we got anything. $sep The [Nourmahul?] was quite a good ship and they made a pretty good escort ship out of her. On the way back I spent most of my time peeling potatoes as I was mess cooking. I finally stood my first watch about 3 days from New York. I was helmsman and quartermaster. We learned quite a bit about navigation - we had to take 50 sights of the sun + stars. While we were at "Gitmo" as they call it, we went for 4 days to A.A. gunnery school, 3 days on the 20mm and the last day on the 40's. The crew that got on the gun after us got sort of blown up when there was a blow back. One guy got quite badly hurt. I have not gotten my service ribbon yet but Gib appeared with his when got back. $sep I am going to the Cape on Fri. after spending the night in Boston with Jack. I hope to be able to go thru his ship. I went thru one just like it at Gitmo. His exec is the birt that taught gunnery at Yale - he is sort of a jerk - I hope he will be better on a ship. Gib is coming too. $sep We have been playing a lot of tennis now that Gib is home. Mom got back from the hospital yesterday, she is still a little feeble but she is managing to get around without a crutch. Cal is all pleased with your potatoes - says they are the best in the town. He is still fighting with "that Sewis" but its not violent. $sep I had a long talk with Ken Hill about what to do with my income when I get through with Yale - I thought I had better get it settled now while I can. Ken said it was all confused because I am underage, but he said he would look into it. If you have any information worth while or any suggestions you might write Ken or I. I hope you are keeping out of the clutches of the 300 f-suiters especially the female ones. Dr G said he was plagued by them -- they thought he was one of them. $sep Well Admiral have fun at school. You have been to so many that everyone here is afraid that you will be so educated that you won't be able to talk to them. Have fun and I hope you won't have to wait too long for your ship. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred

        '''Dear Pop $sep Well I guess I am really in the Navy now, and definately under Naval discipline. We get up every morning at 6:00 [I have been getting up at 5:30 to muster the others] and then have exercises with chow at 7:00. Classes all morning and lots of athletics drills and endurence contests all afternoon. At 5:45 we have inspection then chow, liberty until 2000 and then a chance to study for two hrs with lights out at 2200. You see they've thought od everything but when you can get your work done. They give us the same amount of work to do - 2 hrs for each assignment but some how its impossible to spend more than about an hour apiece on anything. My classes are the same as before but I have and awfull lot of them - much more than anyone else in the room - Dicken, Macdonald, Green, Moorhead, and Early. $sep OF course we have room inspections every morning but so far they haven't found our room yet so we're still OK. Dicken + I are living in a little closet with very little light and no air and so far the temp hasn't gone below 85\u{00B0} and the humidity below 90% so you can see we are very comfortable. $sep We have one really tough Marine corpral here to drill us - they are marines in the college with us - also a marine major straight from Guardal canal. Are they tough! After drilling us for 3 hrs he asked if anyone was tired on unfortunate replied yes. He made him lie down and marched the complete company over him 4 or 5 times with their heads in the air. The poor guy hasn't been seen since. $sep Most of the NROTC men have all the dirty jobs - such as waking the boys up and anything else they can think of. Dicken is a Company Commander and I am the Company C.P.O. which is an pretty easy job. The rest of the lad in 1301 are just mustering P.O's so we have labeled our closet - Ward Room. $sep The life at Yale is certainly different as you can guess. All the fraternities are closed except Zete which is open to all and does a rush business on liberty hours. The senior societies are still functioning which is the only tie to old Yale. The navy has given us liberty untill 2200 on Wednesday so we have meetings then. $sep I hope to be able to get home every now and then as they give us weekend liberty 'till 9:00 Sunday. Of course I'm assuming that they won't have to take my liberty card away for a messy room. $sep I hope your ship is coming along pretty well - write me about her. $nl Have fun out there. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred

        '''Dear Pop, $sep Everything is getting to be pretty much of a routine now. THey only thing we live for is weekends which break up the monotony nicely. We have gotten the corporal under out thumb so to speak - at least he hasn't bothered any of us much of late. So far we all have out liberty cards which is quite a feat as many of the boys have been forced to spend most of their time in Davenport because they lost them. I'm sure that Mom and Wees would be impressed with my neatness around this room; although when we get out of it there is an all most irresistible temptation to drop cigarette ashes on the floor just because we don't have to pick them up. $sep I hope to get home next weekend if all goes well. I went to New York this last and under went a great misfortune, some ___ ___ stole my cap in a night club so that I had to go back to New Haven uncovered - most humiliating. So today I bought an officers cap and put out trimmings on it. $sep All most every one has a uniform now and Tale looks like quite a camp with many different types of uniforms - marines, army, privates + cadets, gobs and us. Officers lead a miserable life because they have to salute so often. When I first got here I got a real thrill I was saluted by a brand new 2nd leut in the army - I felt quite important as you can imagine. I doesn't happen any more. $sep Drop me a line about how things are in Portland. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb Fred

        '''Dear Pop $sep Thanks for the letters and gift, both were greatly appreciated. I am going home tomorrow for the weekend and much needed relazation. Jim Kitt is coming home Sunday night so unfortunately I will just miss him. It will be nice to get home anyway and help prepare a new "Moo". $sep I'm not sure whether I told you or not about my financial affairs. Anyway I got it all fixed up with Ken and Win. When I tell them they are going to put all my money in an account and invest it for me when it has accumulated. So far I have been trying to get a little collected in the bank for my present use, so the program is not underway yet. Any further details can be obtained from Win. Right now I am feeling quite wealthy because with my first pay check I was able to pay up all my bills. Now I am in the black. $sep Room 1301 has been in a great turmoil all week do to may difficulties. Green has lost his liberty card and can't go to see his girl to whom he was going to get ingaged - he has been doing considerable moaning + groaning about it. Dicken has become bearly tolerable because he is constantly trying to assert his authority as highest ranking officer. Macdonald is very wretched just generally. However today being my birthday life has brightened up because it is "be-nice-to-Freddy" day. It's just because I am buying the boy a few drinks during our liberty period. $sep Well here's hoping you will be able to get your ship ready. I think you must be glad Mom is coming out there. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred

        // TODO: find way to attach the letter about insurance and holdings to the entry
        '''Dear Pop, $sep Thanks for the check as yet I have not decided just what to use it for but I have several ideas. I liked the picture of your ship very much. It looks as though you could have a bit of fun on her. I hope will be out on her shortly. I have a swell time at home; it certainly was nice to see Mom again after such a long time. My only regret, outside of the fact that we were not honored by Capt. Murgetroyd's presence, was that there wasn't enough snow for skiing. I was forced under those circumstances to play that wretched game of hockey. It always annoys me to have those wretched little children knocking me down. $sep I went through the mills with Bruce and found all running to my satisfaction. I also had a conference with Win over my financial matters which we have gotten nicely arranged. Enclosed is a copy of the letter Win sent to the bank. I wonder if it would be possible for you to change your pay allottment to the Agi. Bank, agent for Fred Crane Jr. In that way I won't have to endorse it every time. I have arranged to pay for my insurance this year and the bank will take care of it from then on. I hope you will approve of all this. $sep I had my picture taken with my ensign hat on, although it isn't too good I'm sending it anyway as soon as they are ready. I hope I'm not counting my chickens before they're hatched. We don't have long to go now. $sep I got my marks for the mid-term 85, 80, 80, 75, 65. One 85 was in Navy. $sep I'm glad to hear you had a good Christmas but it was too bad you couldn't have been home. A "Moo" is coming out soon to tell you all about it. Hope you can use the shirts I sent you. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred $dbl $tb $tb P.S. I was sorry to hear about Capt. Gainard.

I am taking the day off so that I can go up and see Loomis' magnesium plant. I have to write a long paper on the production of it for one of my chem classes. It shoudl be quite interesting. $sep I am pretty busy now getting equipped with uniforms, etc. Have you any suggestions on grey's or kahki's? It really is pleasant to think that we only have five weeks to go for our stripe, also a degree is a nice thought too. We rather excited about it. I can't say as I feel much more like an officer than I did two years ago, but I guess we'll get along all right. I don't know when we'll get our orders but probably not for a few weeks at least. It seems rather hopeless to think of anything other than landing craft. $sep By the way, did Frank Shafroth get on your ship? $sep Unfortunately I don't think that I'll be able to get home before we are through here. Its such a long trip because I can't get the right connections, and I have to leave so early that that I can only be home for a little white and it hardly seems worth it. I'm afraid I'll have to wait for my leave before I can do any skiing. Mac and Dicken are planning a trip some where for a few days; I may be forced to tag along. $sep Well, tell me how your ship is coming, and I'll let you know just what we get when we get our orders.

        '''$tb The idea for this notebook on observations, thoughts, and to some extent, events, going on in everyday life, has been plaguing me for sometime; now I shall begin it. The purpose will be many fold. First it will give me a chance to put down on paper many ideas and thoughts which are in a very vague state in my mind; by writing them down I will not only clarify them but will also give myself a chance to compare similar ideas at different dates and thus to note changes which are occurring within me. Possibly by noting these changes I may be able to determine the causes for them, which through it may do no one any good will at least serve to satisfy my own curiosity. $sep Secondly, this will serve to stimulate my intellect (I have one you know), which I fear has become very stagnant during the past year, due no doubt to laziness mainly and somewhat to the lack of stimulating surroundings. Of course in writing down odds and ends, I expect that I will no doubt aid my mode of self expression and also my writing in general. It should be excellent training for clearer and more shaped thinking, something else that I'm afraid is declining in me. From these ideas I should be able to draw more interesting material for letters and for conversation. Now that I no longer have Cousin Barbara to whom I can pour out my troubles, gripes and basic philosophy, I will put them all down in this little book; a far better idea I'm sure for I will be able to refer to them at will.  $sep And thirdly, I expect that I may produce some useful and helpful ideas upon which I may draw at some future date. It should even be interesting to reread after the war is over and recall the happenings which may have brought on these observations.  $sep And now for a word or two on procedures and subjects. I expect to continue this book faithfully, though knowing my weaknesses as I do, I should not be surprised if at sometime it died a sudden and youthful death. I must do my best to look on this as a challenge which I must meet. If it is to be worth while at all it must be kept pretty well up to date without too many long gaps. I must show myself that I can keep my enthusiasm for an idea and see it through. Now look here, you know how many times you have gotten all excited over something, only to grow tired of it and quit when the work began to grow dull. Work will always grow dull in time but you must stick to it to get any results.  $sep Now another point; if this is to be a true picture of yourself, you must be *frank*. No gilding the lily! Just because something didn't go quite the way you expected, don't change it. Dreaming is fine but it has its place and it is not in a report. Don't be ashamed to admit your failure. Show your weakness. If you were wrong and the fault is yours, you may as well put it down in here, because it is no worse than admitting it to yourself. It is a simpleton who tries to fool himself as well as others. And don't forget to keep your dreams and the true facts separate; imagination is fine but don't let it confuse you.  $sep There is to be no limit as to what goes in here, everything is acceptable from corny or amusing tales, purely imaginative dreams to the straight historic facts, but keep them separate and keep them clearly labeled. When in an idle moment you let your mind wander, why not set down some of your observations. It won't hurt you and a little writing will keep you on the touch.  $sep As you ream off at the mouth, so to speak, try to write it well as though it were for 'Cookie' or some other English prof. Keep an eye open for organization, grammar, and vocabulary. Who knows it may even help your spelling. Slang and colloquialisms are all right when in a conversational style but keep them out of anything which attempts to be serious unless it is for that humorous break.  $sep Now carry on, and don't feel that its too much work. Show me you can do it! Do a little imaginative and analytical thinking.''',

        '''$tb On viewing my father's ship, for the first time, and noticing a few items in respect to discipline and morale I have come to the conclusion that I need to change a few of my ideas on handling men and leadership. Men will follow another man for three reasons, respect, confidence, and discipline; and it has been difficult to fit these three together.  $sep My policy has been to gain their friendship and thus to coax or persuade the men rather than command. This policy has its faults. Namely, men will not be led just because they think you are a pleasant chap. They will obey orders when forced by the will of the other and not when coaxed.  $sep Respect and confidence do hand in hand, when you have one you will gain the other. But this is difficult to do. Respect comes from your ability to do something better than another, or something the other can not do and from character and personality and friendship. Others will believe in your ability when they have it proven to them and when they come to trust your judgment.  $sep How can I gain these two necessary requirements? First, I should try to know as much if not more about the engineering dep't as the men under me. At least I should know enough to understand and size up all problems which may occur. It is not absolutely necessary that I know all the mechanisms of the problem but it is a great help, so long as I can come to a quick decision on what action to take. Any decision is better than none. One must gain his own confidence before he can expect to gain others. If you think you can do the job probably others will think so too. If I were to tear down a pump quicker than one of the chiefs I would probably gain some respect but not assuredly their confidence. Confidence would come from my ability to meet circumstances better than they. My knowledge of the details and intricacies of the pump would be a great help in my making a good decision as well as gaining my own confidence. My program will be to learn more details and to face the problems squarely and frequently to gain experiences and confidence.  $sep When these are gained, discipline can be easily maintained. But there are other parts. Friendship is a big help but should definitely not be relied on solely. The men will obey more easily and in better humor if the like you but this is not an absolute prerequisite. Too much friendship is harmful for that old saying "familiarity breeds contempt" still holds. It is better to remain somewhat aloof and reserved so that your human weaknesses will be less apparent. You should demand a certain amount of respect for your rank, at least, if not for yourself. [From now on make sure you are addressed as Mr. and sir]. Unbending and friendliness should be practiced at the proper time and place as the make the men feel that you are not stuffy or conceited, but be sure you discriminate between friendliness and weakness. That is the most difficult part and the part which can only be learned by experience. Use force as little as possible; every time you put a man on report you are admitting that you have failed; you admit to weakness. *Never use threats!* Use your will power and the force of your personality. a good "cussing out" at times does a great deal more good than harsher disciplinary action. Remember to do all you can for the crew without being soft; give them every break.  $sep I believe Pop to be so successful because he has a strong will and experience to know when and how much discipline to apply. He has the respect of his age and rank as well as his ability, to help him out. He enforces the policy of saluting and standing in the presence of the C.O. which is more easily done than with our skipper. A.S.B. would have a great deal of difficulty starting that aboard the Trever. If seems to be then times harder to build up discipline than to maintain it. Pop is able to maintain higher efficiency because he places faith in his officers which in turn is placed in him, and his discipline is kept uniformly. On the Trever it is unbalanced toward the smaller items. It may be relaxed somewhat on the smaller details but the important ones should be kept ridgedly. "The Beaver" is too fussy about the small items and too lax about the important ones. It is strange bu minor irritations are generally more annoying that a large inconvenience. It is the constant minor problems which make or break morale. The main reason for the Caution having better discipline, morale and upkeep is due to Pops deeper understanding of human nature. $dbl Hints for me:$nltb Electrical Dep't - Keep better informed as to work being done and requiring work. More thorough understanding of electrical equipment and work. More knowledge of what should be done and how. Thorough inspections and insistence on cleanliness. More pressure applied to Shelly and Proza to see that work is done. $nltb Engineering Dep't - More knowledge of plant and operation. Demand more respect from men and more obedience. $nltb Aft. Compartment - More inspections, more influence for Vail. Sacks and decks and lockers neater.'''

        '''$tb I have decided that one of the things I must do in my future peace-time life is to be active in politics. I believe it is every intelligent mans duty to play a part in the government of his country, and if possible an active part. There are so many people who are incompetent and stupid that the more intelligent and educated men we can have in politics the better we shall be for it. $sep Politics in this country for the last fifty years has been a pretty dirty job with few real compensations to the honest man and thus it has kept the well educated and ambitions soul away from it. People have left the job of running the country and making its laws to the back slapper, grafter and big machine boss. Considering what we have often had in the government, federal as well as state, we have done remarkably well but it has been far from satisfactory. We should take the cue from the British where it is the duty of every well educated man to play a part in the government in some way we must entice the educated men to enter politics as a career and certainly to get the majority to at least enter in. $sep At present, business men etc. refuse to have anything to do with politics other than vote, sometimes give a little money to the campaign fund of the party which will benefit them most, and mostly just grumble about the country going to the dogs. Just because one doesn't believe in some of the activities and methods used does't excuse one from remaining in one party or the other; refusing to give support and "growling" to oneself will do no good, but active disapproval or diplomatic leading[?] may help. At least its a try. I believe my father was wrong when he drop from the American Legion because he did not believe in its policies or entering politics; too many others dropped out who might have been able to guide it along a more useful path. $sep One thing I believe is that after this war the veterans organizations will be potentially a great political factor. I therefore feel I should enter them wholeheartedly and try to help direct them on useful courses. I will try to gain a position of some importance in the organization. This organization can very easily be lead to do great harm to the country; it can follow the footsteps of its infamous predecessor which only agitated for veterans bonuses etc; large expenditures of money for a very small percentage of the population. It will do no good when this sort of thing occurs to get out of it and then condemn it; it won't be stopped that way. The only way I see to prevent its doing the same old barrel stuffing is to see that intelligent and sincere men gain control so that its influence can be used for the good of the country as a whole. Possibly there will be two organizations which would be an excellent thing as it would prevent one from becoming too autocratic. $sep As for my actual assuming a position of responsibility in such an organization; I'm not sure about how to go about it, but I expect I can see and learn the "angles" in due time. I suspect that enthusiasm, support and interest should be the beginning and that one can go on from there. Also influential friends are always a help. I have great hopes that someday some of my acquaintances will amount to some pretty important people. I shall not hesitate to use their friendships and influence to help me in any way along these lines. There are places where I draw the line but worry about them later. I do not wish to confine myself to this Veterans Organization, but I hope also to enter local and national party politic as well. I do not expect to be the actual front figure who makes speeches and holds office; I would prefer to be one of the men called in to discuss policies, or select candidates, actually an influence behind the throne. If my first plan succeeds, gaining influence in the Legion or its substitute, it should be relatively easy to have an effect on party politics. I must also gain the friendship and confidence of the local politicos and through them the more important figures. I will not forgo too many of my ideals such as hypocrisy, insincerity, "sucking around[?]" though I expect there will be a lot of it going on around be. One cannot prevent these things by saying "I don't believe in it. I quit." one can do a great deal more good by subtly working from the inside. $sep Actually I don't intend to make it a career or be a small time boss, but rather a very active observer; one who is present at conventions, knows the candidate, possibly have an ear with the governor or senator. And the purpose of this? Mainly because I believe more good can be done for politics in this country and the results of politics, government and laws, by working on the inside than griping on the outside. I also hope to bring in a few others with education and background. Our country has the men but they are poorly distributed. $sep This idea, though stimulated by seeing the movie "Wilson", is really not new; I have had it on my mind ever since my arguments and discussions with Patterson and Furges on Tulagi last summer.'''

        '''$tb My present existence being rather dull and the laughs and gags of the old days comming few and far between, I feel that a little light dreaming on the pleasant past is in order. I hope this will not be a bad sign that I'm showing my weakness toward being a sentimental old fart.  Let us not drift too much in the nostalgic past.$sep What the navy really needs is is more humor and particularly the Trever; the wit and repartee is far from snappy aboard this might vessel. Really we are all far too stuffy. My best corner in the field of humor is in anecdotes and the material I have to work with recently is very limited. The only recent experiences worthy of note: my return to the ship *rather*  inebriated with numerous possessions of one Everet Wilkinson a (jq) whom I cannot recall having ever met, and the bowing and scrapping of The Beaver when Pop came aboard; "Davis, bring the cmdr a clean plate." are far from the caliber of the tales gathered in 1301. Then there was wonderful material presented after every weekend; it never failed but that one of us would preform in some outstanding manner. The real joy, though, came in the telling and retelling, the criticisms and the few witty remarks which used to sneak into the conversations after a great deal of effort.$sep Honestly I must change my tack for this is getting me no place. I shall now delve into the realms of pure imagination, such as Crane the Hero, Crane Successful, Crane the Bourbon ______.$sep The move tonight, "National Valet" has made me decide that I really never took enough advantage from out stables, "You must have heard of the Crane stables". Though I have always enjoyed riding somehow I've done very little of it in the past eight years. To me it is a very unique sport since it must be done alone or with someone you are very close to. It frequently lacks the thrill of skiing or racing unless you are jumping. However it does give one that quiet restful enjoyment of nature which one gets craising[?].$sep It is a great pleasure to get away from everything and everybody, to be alone just you and your horse and the great outdoors. I can remember well the many times I've ridden up the Boulder Trail by myself and the grand feeling i've gotten just being free, alive the weather is beautiful, the scenery grand. My troubles and worries, if I have any, are completely gone; inhibitions disappear. I get the wonderful independent feeling, the horse and I are one. I talk to him and sing to myself, I'm completely happy. My imagination works overtime and I'm a complete child again dreaming great adventures and believing in them and myself implicitly. To do this with a girl you are possibly in love with is one of the pleasentest things I know. You can talk and pour out your soul or just ride and think them together. $sep What is there about riding that does this, is it the horse or the nature? I guess its both. Whenever I'm out in the open on a beautiful day I feel good, and that's the only way to express it, just good; happy to be alive and no other reason. But when I'm on a horse its even better, for there you have a perfect companion, one you don't have to explain to and one who feels as you do. Also when suddenly you can't contain the happiness and exuberance within you, give her her head and let her run, shout at the wind whailing by and the horse under you. Just let her go in those great open spaces its all yours, the whole world for the asking. you are tearing along with animal under you; when feeling like this you are no doubt closer to complete unity with another being than at any other time; where she goes you want to go. Then comes the thrill in making the horse obey you, of taming that powerful creature beneath you with your will. If you jump there is plenty of thrill; just like skiing a trail just in control, you can the horse are matched, neither behind the other. It's a great sport.$sep This is all very incongruous and disorganized but you can see how I warmed up as I got into the subject. Its been a long time since I rode like that and may it never be so long from now on.$sep Here's a pleasant little dream along the same subject:$sep I'm home and have a girl visiting me, a girl I'm in love with and who understands me well and who I understand and can really talk to. Lets call her Barbara because Coz[?] would have come pretty close to filling the picture. We start out early in a June morning while the dew is still on the trees and trot on out to the Green Gates Road. Its very cool and still as we walk along the in the hollow; the sun is just hitting the upper branches of the Hemlocks, and the dew glitters on the spider webs hanging across the trail. Underfoot the leaves are moist and the horses feeling so frisky as we jog along noiselessly. We do not speak for it seems a shame to break the stillness, which is emphasized by the warble of a bird and the crack of a twig.$sep I ride ahead saying nothing just feeling food because I know she is with me and thinking the same thought. I look back and smile at her and a wealth of sympathetic understanding passes between us. We pass over the bridge and the hooves on the wooden planking make a musical note as we cross over. We are early pioneers moving through the forest and this was our only mode of travel; we are explorers seeking new lands; the imaginations go on and one. The feeling of adventure is soon replaced by a feeling of reverence as we pass through the temple made by the lofty trees. The slow rhythm of the horse, the stillness and the beauty of the scene fill me with particularly religious feeling. $sep Soon we pass through this to the Gulf Road where the mood changes. The horses make more noise on the dirt road and the sun is brighter; we talk now of the beauty of the woods. The tempo quickens and move along at a trot. We turn off up the mountain road. The change of scenery with the hardwoods letting in more light and the frequent clearings, changes the feeling of reverence to gaiety and exuberance. As we come to the clearings we canter along, slowly at first but as the footing gets better we let the horses go. We slow after a bit with the blood pounding and a flush in our cheeks and stroll along talking now. I point out scenes along the way and tell of days in my youth. We unburden many secret thoughts and desires. I probably do too much of the talking as I show her the trees I planted; where we all used to ride. I tell of my join in just being free, in having room to move in. She tells of her early riding experiences and her trials and tribulations.$sep As we stop on the knoll where the trees have not yet become to high so as to cut off the sun, where the gentle breeze blowing up from the valley. There we dismount and rest, tethering the horse. We sit on a mossy rock looking down into the valley and watch the train go chugging up the grade on Day Mountain across the valley. The houses and fields are spread out before us like a painting. So fresh and clean in the early sun that they don't look real. Here the subject changes to more personal items; families, homes, futures. We try to picture what is happening in the white cottage below us.$sep We get back on out horses and start the return, again the moods and conversation change with the scenery and the gait. We return to the house weary, relaxed, laughing, and ready for a big lunch.$sep God forbid that I who love nature and the great outdoors, should ever have to live long in the city. And please God may I never be too far from the sea or the snow. If ever I have to live somewhere other than New England, let it be the Pacific Northwest.''',

        '''$tb For the time being these arguments will only be of theoretical value as I expect the time is quite distant when I will be called upon to make a decision. Someday the time will come, i think, when I will have to decide and it may be better for me to have all my ideas, pro and con, put down so I will be able to, in the future, to see what caused my decision.$sep The first and main reason why I would advocate not making a career of the Navy is the difficulty it presents to a happy family life. Shipboard or shore station the same problem is present, uncertainty and constant movement. To properly raise a family the way I with to requires a permanent home in a fairly small community, a stable family life as I was accustomed. This is practically impossible when the longest time in one place is from one to three years. And the years of sea duty are also a great menace; even though much of the time may be spent ashore, there will always be considerable periods of maneuvers and cruises. These would certainly be no help to married life. It would be well nigh impossible for me to do many of the things I love so much, sailing, skiing, riding. These activities would be hard to fit in under a Navy program. I want to enjoy these sports with my whole family and when I want; I don't want my family time limited. The effect of the Navy on married life is easily seen by the large number of navy divorces.$sep I don't care much for the navy community or the way of promotion. The intrigue and politics of such a set up would undoubtedly throw me. Not being an Academy man would not give me much of a start and I know I'm not much suited to a life of shrewd deals and sucking around. I want to relax and be natural when I'm home. I also don't think much of the navy friendships, so many of them are forced upon you by close contact when you have no choice in who it is. I would rather be somewhere where I had a reasonable number of people to choose my friends from.$sep Then comes the idea of mine that I would probably be a better business man or chemist than I would a naval officer. Although that point may never be decided accurately.$sep Now for a few points on why there is any argument at all, why I would even consider remaining in the service. The main reason is the fact that being a goof officer still offers a challenge to me. I want to be what one would consider an excellent officer, skipper or exec; I want to be admired, looked up to, and followed. This I have not yet done. But I can imagine it would be one of the most flattering things that could happen and be one of the greatest thrills in life to have a really taut ship and have the men and officers really admire you. I can think of nothing more satisfying. That one challenge would cause me more regret than anything else about leaving the navy.$sep Then of course there is always the adventure and the romance attached to a roving life, new places and faces, new jobs and some exciting ones, adventure. Yes, there are plenty of possibilities for all of that in the peace-time navy. All the things that would make life hard for married men would be fairly attractive to a bachelor. There is also a certain undeniable prestige connected with a naval officer and it would certainly be something different than most of my friends.$sep All of these arguments could be torn apart by those that know and have done it. There must be plenty of happy and successful families in the regular navy, as well as bored and unsuccessful bachelors but their percentage would not be high. Interesting speculation but only time will tell.$sep A man who wishes to make the navy a career should above all things get experience in aviation. It is apparent to me that though the plane will never entirely displace the ship, it will reduce the navy's position in the next war to a relatively minor position. A ship is intrinsically a very vulnerable object because it is so concentrated. Any ship consists of a very sizable investment of time and money all placed in a very small area. Tactics such as the present suicidal[?] dives make this a great weakness, for one plane, a sunk or extensively damaged ship, a much larger investment. In the next war with its improvements on bombs, radio control jets, etc., the problem of ship defense will certainly be very great. The advantage will continue to go to the smallest, cheapest, most destructive weapon.$sep The most pleasant day I've spent since seeing Pop was 20 May when I saw so many of the old Yale's; Early, Seaman, Wyer, Grobstine, and P.A. Ken Kend? and Bantar Kuskand Kevin Kenedy. With so may of us so game it was just like the old days at college. The songs, the laughter and drinks were very similar. The surrounding were different but above all there was that certain note of sadness and seriousness. There was also a feeling of desperation that we must enjoy this for we may never all be together again, certainly not for a long time. There was a distinct difference in the topics for conversation which dealt so much with the past rather than the future, as the so often used to at Yale. $sep It was fun and an experience of which I will always be grateful. It's too bad it can't happen more often.$sep I have decided definitely that I want to get of the TREVER, particularly now that we are to be converted to a target tower. Last time out there was always hope of getting in a little action and as a matter of fact we did have a few exciting times, which in a way made up for the hear, bum food, lack of mail etc.; but this time the duty is awfully dull and there is no hope of change, only the possibility of going west and its getting worse. I want to get off to see how a newer ship runs, to compare the organization, the equipment, spirit, and efficiency. I would like to see a new bunch of officers and a new skipper; I'd like to see how i fit in. I want this to be a fighting ship too so I can watch the organization in action and I want to learn. It would, I think, be much easier on a newer ship as there would be more incentive in a snappy organization. My old craving for action and my curiosity about my behavior have again taken over. I've no doubt there will be times when I will wish I was back on the easy duty aboard the AG110 but on the whole I don't think I'll regret it. ''',

        '''$tb Having heard a rumor that Early and Seaman had been seen around town, I wended my way over to the Officers Club in the hopes that I might see them and if not I could drown my sorrows in a few rounds of drinks. upon my arrival I found those two worthies, Mr Seull[?] and Mr Bones already imbibing[?] in a few. If this was not enough to cause a celebration in itself, and I assure you it was; I've gotten pretty drunk on worse excuses than that; four more Eli's showed up, among them that old man from Elm Street Jim Wyer. Naturally amidst this this motley crew there were bound to be a few, and it easy enough to guess, who would be game for a little strenuous drinking.$sep As we were unable to find suitable accommodations we were forced to remain at the club after it closed at 1800, faGuardia[?] would crap, armed with five quarts of that celebrated scotch-type "the Wilkins Family"; for your information it used to sell on the prewar market at 65¢ a pint. Despite the discouragement of a rather second-rate whiskey and accommodations which were somewhat outside the law, a few of the gamer characters, need I say more, stayed to the bitter end, and I may add by 2300 it was pretty bitter. The party would have done justice to on of those raucous affairs given by Fat Mac Marshman himself without the women, bartenders, or Rene Meyer, overcome by sentiment sticking his sword through the ceiling as a finale to Bright College Years; we didn't have the sword. In short there was really nothing but liquor and good fellows. The singing was beautiful, Early and I still shriking[?] for the Whiffs, you know; and the wit most refreshing, although not as original as it once was; the party was a complete success. And to top it all off there was a snapper just in memory of that great Scotch drinker Flyer Bill Early as a climax, overcome by memories of that noble drinker, quietly snapped, and with great finesse, I might add, in a secluded corner.$sep The singing was exquisite though we lacked our own (George M Cohen) Marshman to pull us through a few snappy "For I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy" complete with gestures. Early and I tried to make up for the lack but failed rather miserably as I stumbled over a chair. The Wiff. song rendered in six or seven part harmony was touching, bringing tears to our eyes. All in all a grand evening reminiscent of some of those spent at Zate, lacking of course the able services of Norm Higgins and of COurse Molly and her girls were missed sorely.''',

        '''$tb If I were a poet I could probably express my feelings for Jim, or if I were a writer I might be able to analyze him and our relationship, but qualifying as neither I will merely put down a few random notes on my roommate and closest friend for seven years. It is nine months since his death and over a year since I saw him last and somethings I may have forgotten, but those are the minor points, most of Jim I will never forget; I only write this so that I may refresh my memory from time to time with thoughts of that delightful character.$sep Jim was a funny guy, a very unique character, one that would be hard to classify. Perhaps the first thing one would notice about him was his powerful personality. He contained one of the strongest will of anyone I have ever known. He was not terribly stubborn but he had a way of getting people to do what he wanted. That was the main cause of the minor conflicts between he and I. I always hated to bow to his will and would struggle to the last but the majority of the time I would lose. Even at that time I could never say exactly how he did it but the results were there. At first he would not impress you as a very responsible man as he was usually picking holes in the existing organization, but it was always apparent that he was a leader. In his own insidious way he could command a large number of followers. When the chips were down and Jim had a position of responsibility he met it fully. I remember the first time I realized this was when he was given the job of supplying food for the party at AGC before the prom. Without too much ado he produced an excellent feed. Perhaps it was better illustrated in his handling of the Phillipian the next year, but in all respects Jim lived up to his responsibilities.$sep Jim had one of the most original wits of any in the class. Though it may not have been the most brilliant, I may say he was probably the most quoted man in in our circle of acquaintances. Almost all the phrases which are connected with our days of Yale have come from a Dicken remark; "Ah, my non-commissioned friend"; "You are Jewish you know". Along with his wit went his very discerning mind. Jim was a very hard man to bluff and even a harder man to fool. He was particularly sharp in picking holes in his instructors arguments to say nothing of making a fool of me almost every time a [got?] started, a thing I might add that he loved to do. His writing was correspondingly witty and amusing; for example that theme he wrote for Cookie on the CCC and his many little poems and limericks.$sep Basically Jim was quite shy and would never put himself forward until he was on sure ground. In front of strangers or older people he seldom said much but usually but on his little shit, innocent act which so endeared him to our parents. Yet on ground that he was sure of he did his utmost to get all he could. Among his friends he took great pleasure in doing [thus?] at every turn and pulling a slick deal. THis must not be thought of as taking advantage of friendships or using us, for with him it was merely a game; no one could be long associated with him without getting in the spirit of the thing. among the roomies it was his greatest pleasure to pull some shrewd deal whereby we suffered and he gained. However if things were too tough he was only too glad to help out; perhaps not glad but with a few chosen words on our stupidity he would rather reluctantly help out. Jim had that wonderful ability of knowing just when and where to draw the line; he never went to far.$sep One of his most interesting characteristics was his fear of appearing to be soft hearted. Next to being made a sucker, he hated showing any sentiment or loyalty. Yet within him was one of the warmest hearts that ever beat. Only when forced would he ever admit loyalty to anything, yet he never let anyone down. I never heard him say anything particularly nice to me except when drunk and yet I know he had great affection for me. It was a never ending source of amazement to hear from someone else the complimentary things he'd said when not ten minutes before he had been telling me in no uncertain terms what a fool I was. The other amazing part to him was his paternal car of me; he was constantly dressing me in the tone of a father, forever lecturing me on my foolish ways, many of which were identical to his. When at my home he used to have long talks with my sister on ways of properly bringing me up He was that way with all the roomies though mainly to Flyer and I, probably because we needed it more than the rest. His constant criticisms during the years I knew him probably had more to do with the formation of my character than any other influence outside my family.$sep His attitude toward women was another peculiarity of his. I don't believe he ever felt at east with any nice girl. Though he was well liked by them all except when drunk he still had that shy attitude of his. I think he was quite lonely for some girl that would really understand him. Probably one of the reasons he so liked Pam was due to her understanding of him. He could talk to her much better than any of the others. I wonder what would have come of that if he'd lived? With "pigs" Jim was an expert, or at least he was highly successful, due no doubt to his never say die technique and lack of taste at late hours. With them he wasted no time on talk but got down to the basic idea in mind, a very interesting performance to watch.$sep Jim was colorful, I believe there are more anecdotes concerning Dicken than any man in the class. He had a great facility for telling tales on himself and a great ability to laugh at himself. There were very few things that he was too embarrassed to tell about if they could furnish a good laugh. He was the most honest man with himself that I'll ever know. His same clear thinking, with which he would analyze others he \[cast?\] with great success on himself. I could go on at length on the tales he has told of the situations hes been in, but they are only too familiar.$sep My epitaph to Dicken is only this; I am honored above all by the friendship he had for me, I cannot only say he was the greatest friend I ever had.''',

First and foremost  of course there was Dody bringing back many pleasant memories and thoughts of days which seem to be centuries away. There were the old familiar cracks and wit, said in the type of company where it originated,m there was Phil Barrie and the others all of who fitted in with the type of people I used to associate so much., The conversation was so familiar, the things I said and enjoyed were appreciated and vice versa. $sep But this is all a side line, what I really enjoyed and would have enjoyed in any company was my non-commissioned friend, Hemmingway. She was delightful, prettier than ever, and just as charming and sincere. It's impossible to explain why she made me feel the way I did; it was no only that everything went so well, but somehow I just enjoyed being with her. It was not our talk of Yale or mutual friends that did it, nor even our talks of ourselves, but just to be talking to her. And when I kissed her that was it, or at least the best [initiation?] I've had since Feb of 1944. What I'm getting at is that for this weekend I was in the pits [in love to you uninitiated].

        '''$tb I am particularly pleased with my new job for a number of reasons and I hope that the future will bear me out.$sep For the first time since I've been aboard the Trever I feel that I have a job of some importance and a position with some responsibility attached to it. Until now, I've had the feeling that the ship would really be able to get along just as well without me  and that the work I did could be just as well preformed by a capable petty officer. As electrical officer I had full responsibility for that branch of the department but I didn't feel that there was enough there to warrant an officer for full time. Also my knowledge of electricity being what it is I did not feel qualified to be of any great assistance to my men other than in an entirely administrative capacity and there was never enough men to keep me at maximum work.$sep I've always been one who worked best and most efficiently when pressed to my maximum. I've always enjoyed work when I think I'm getting something done or when I can flatter my ego by thinking what I'm doing is important. I've always wanted to see how I would meet any large responsibility, and now I have the chance to see how I'll make out. I feel that handling a decision constitutes a real challenge with its discipline and numerous administrative problems, not I have a chance to see how I'll meet that challenge.$sep On the whole I am looking forward eagerly to the next few months to see how I'll turn out. Up till now I've been full of doubts as to whether I've been what I consider a good officer. I've been weak in maintaining discipline and respect, but now with this job I'll get some practice and experience. I'll probably be able to enforce a little more respect if I really believe I've earned it. All I need is to build up a little confidence.

        '''$tb The change in the atmosphere since The Beaver left is astonishing; everyone has brightened up, smiled and thought maybe this duty isn't so bad after all. I have felt it especially. Since he has left I've felt a new rush of confidence in myself, a feeling entirely lacking before; I've looked at my fellow officers and thought they really weren't such a bad lot after all. I've looked at my new job with eagerness and anticipation; previously any added responsibility was to be feared rather than hoped for. I can talk to Phil when I have any problems and don't regret having asked advice. As a matter of fact I'm pretty well reconciled to remaining aboard for another year and it does not depress me.$sep The trouble with our old skipper was he had an uncanny nack of making me feel uncomfortable. I never felt free to ask him advice or offer suggestions; I never felt easy whenever he was entering in the conversation. He seemed [to] have a very a very narrow point of view. His other main trouble was his lack of apportioning responsibility among his officers and men. The officers like to feel that they are officers and that the captain has faith in their ability. In my case I did more work and felt better about each time I had an increase in responsibility; I believe that the same is true of the others.$sep The change is certainly noticeable in the wardroom. The dinner table it cheery jokes and corny sayings are passed around freely. Cheeriness and good-humor are much more prevalent now. In fact one might say that this is a good ship.$sep How much this will effect the efficiency of the ship remains to be seen; however the responsibility now lies directly on the officers. We may hope for the best.''',

        '''$tb The peace following this war will be a far greater fight than the war itself ever was, and the chances of out winning it far slimmer. The chances of completely ending all wars is almost impossible but we may hope to prevent another one for many hears. The war in itself had already laid the seeds of future wars and it seems to me that no matter how good the peace, it cannot blight them all.$sep The biggest effect of this war has been the opening of the east. Future historians will no doubt say that the war with Japan was caused by the economic clash between the western power and the rising eastern power of Japan. This conflict will be anything but ended by the completion of hostilities; in fact conflict will be heightened. Peace of 1950 will see a great rise in the power and prestige of the eastern world. We have already laid the foundations for a great rise of industry in China and India. Due to our presence there and out help, a few generations will see these two nations as industrial powers. They can no longer be dismissed as as countries still in the dark ages; we are now at the beginning of their Renaissance. Of course Russia is to be considered since she is essentially an eastern power, or will be at the end of the war. Her Renaissance period is nearly complete and during the war she has risen from a second rate country to probably the most influential power of all.$sep Chine will be the first to follow the Russian footsteps; with her might resources and tremendous supply of man power; she, when fully developed, will become a tremendous influence in the political and economic world. This peace will see her become fully industrialized. Already we are planning to send engineers to help construct hydroelectric plants, steel mills and numerous other factories. All that is needed is the education of the Chinese and this has certainly been furthered a long ways by our presence and aid to her during this war. By the very act of winning this war are we sowing the seeds of the next.$sep India will follow the same track though it will probably be slower than that of the Chinese. As soon as India ships from the grasp of the British as she inevitably will, she [cue?] develop rapidly. The British have nearly completed their usefulness as colonizers and empire makers and their influence will gradually recede. With American, British, and Russian money flowing in to build and construct it will not take India long to become another great power.$sep We can see today at the peace table the difficulties which one eastern power is causing us; think then of the day when there are three. These powers will outnumber us in men and resources and in their growing they will throw our economic set up even more out of kilter. In their growing stage they will furnish a great market but already Russia has her finger in the pie. We will need to get up plenty early in the morning to catch the Russians asleep. The comming age will see the east growing up to the west, and I fear passing her.We will not give up without a struggle but if we fight we shall be defeated.$sep The world as I see it as decade offer the end of hostilities will be made up of three major influences: the Anglo-American in South America and the British, Canada and Australia; the Russians which will consist of nearly all of Europe and most of the Middle East; and the Far East rising powers China and India. The first conflicts will appear between China and Russia as the Russians try to influence the Chinese. Though China may become Communist I do not believe she will ever long be totally influenced by Russia. The trouble [with] the peace treaties is that they can never successfully control the influence of economics. ''',

        '''$tb The most widely talked of and thought of subject when men are segregated from women is the subject of sex. In this talking and thinking along theses line comes the problem of seduction and the morals of it all. $sep I am no strong believer in the morals connected with seduction and intercourse because I find my point of view changing frequently; changing with the environment, weather, society and presence and influence of women. On the whole I believe that sex should be treated naturally and in a manner similar to any desire; it should be indulged in in moderation and to such a degree that there are no harmful effects. Due to the nature of the thing intercourse can be anything from a great delight to grabby orgy, and the latter is to be avoided. Being away from the company of women is apt to heighten the importance of the act itself. It seems to me that the most important part to it is the love sympathy and the feeling of of having given great pleasure to the other, that goes with the act itself. $sep Therefore using the above assumption, the only way to gain any real pleasure from this is by seduction; this also elliminates whores, "victory girls" and all of the "beastly pigs" one usually picks up very late on those drunken evenings. $sep Naturally we must take under consideration, first the girls. For me this is an easy problem in a way, though it has led nearly constantly to my complete failure. I've got to enjoy and like the girl before I can do a thing. The rough and tough usual pick up I can't stand, so she is out. Pick a girl you would enjoy if you were just going to go dancing or take to a party. If you like her half the problem is solved. $sep Now the object is for her to like you. This should be done naturally as you would with anyone and no particular object in mind. You treat her politely and thoughtfully -- just relax and act natural. Either she'll like you or she won't so don't sweat over it. Then tak it easy; don't go rushing for the bunk as soon as she shows any signs of [warming?] up. You don't have to neck her th first night. You might make a gentle pass just to prove your a man but nothing forceful. $sep Take her out for a while until necking becomes a mater of course. Take her to nice places and have a good clean time. By this time you ought to be pretty interested in her in a friendly and physical way, but don't weaken. Now comes the time when careful plans must be made and charmingly executed. The main point is to find a place, quiet, comfortable, and above all where you are safe from interruption; also it must not be obvious A hotel room firs the bill on certain occasions but in general it is too obvious unless you can think up a suitable excuse. An apartment is good, your own or the girls if her family are out of the way and her girl friend taken care of. If the weather is warm enough, the beach is good. But above all the strategic location is essential and take a good bit of thought. Before arriving at your "lovers lair" a decoy should be presented or a red herring led across the trail such as going to a movie or a show anything which will end early enough to give you plenty of operating time and get her in the mood for a bit of loving. $sep When the players are in position the first move should be toward a comfortable spot. Then proceed along the usual lines for necking. Make sure you don't rush things but above all don't weaken but keep pushing things along. In general a guy is inclined to feel pretty satisfied and just let things go but you've got to keep moving along, never retreat and don't stop. Girls are human and have very strong desires; its up to you to arouse them and then keep going. One must be persistent. She may not actually want to, but she can be persuaded. $sep This sounds as though I've had a lot of experience with this wort of thing. Actually I've made a number of attempts but my batting average is low. We'll see how it is after this trip to the states! 
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  9 Oct 1945
  $tb I've more or less clarified my ideas on the morals and ethics concerning sexual relations. For my particular case, I've decided that I'll take what I can get with the following exceptions, whores, prostitutes, and real pigs are out, they don't even count. Of the other girls, I will let the choice be mainly thiers, for though I'll be persistant as all Hell and do my share fully, I'll do nothing really nasty like getting her too drunk to realize it or too grabby. $sep My ideas on the subject for women are that it is really up to them, when they really feel it is right and something they want and when they think it will be good, why go ahead. For some girls I'm convinced they'd do much better and be better and truer wives if they had a little experience before marriage. Not that they should sleep with every man who comes along, wut when they find someone they like a lot and who likes them, then go ahead.

        '''Dear Pop, $sep I just got your letter telling me about struggling to get a ride to Tremblant; despite the trials I wish I were going withyou. I hope you have a fine time and the snow is good. $sep Yesterday I took the trial run of the Bausell (DD 845) down to Boston and it was a grand trip. We made 35 - 36 knots all the way with no strain at all. I think they are wonderful ships and only wish mine were all ready to go too. The engineering plant is a honey; it looks very complicated at first with steam lines running all over the place but once you catch on it really quite simple. I'm not half so scared of it now as I was before. The ship rides a little rough when she is making that speed and I may say that some of the boys didn't enjoy the trip as much as I; I found quite a few looking for mermaids and it was a wet day for that. $sep I enquired from the SupShips about your going down with us on our trip and he said it would be all right. I have to make out some kind of a letter or something but it will be OK for you to come. We will go down to Boston on the 5th, the same day we are commissioned. We leave here at 7 in the morning, get there about noon and are commissioned at 3 o'clock. I'll get the invitations for you and Mom and Pam if she can come. $sep A few more of my men have arrived and from the looks of it none of them will have any experience on the type of a ship; how ever I guess they will be able to get on t o the plant before we go into commission. One of my chiefs arrived and the very first night I had to rescue him from the local jail, but he seems to have squared a way now; at least I hope so. The skipper is due to arrive tomorrow and from all reports he is a pretty good man. He has just come from command of another can [??] which is a good sign at least, his name is Cmdr B.A,Smith and he was on the Murphy. The exec is also reported to be a square gut though I don't know first hand. Anyway it sounds good and all I can do is hope. There are still only two of us here but I expect there will be a few more with the skipper. I hope he won't think that I haven't done enough but I have been pretty handicapped by lack of personnel and not knowing just what he wanted done. $sep Write me about the snow conditions and how the flying mile looks to you. Give my best to the McCallum's. Have fun. $sep $tb $tb Love $nl $tb $tb $tb Fred
